        "content": "The Federal Reserve has joined its fellow U.S. banking regulators in deleting its crypto guidance of previous years, including notices that banks should get pre-approvals before they get involved in crypto activity. Now, all three agencies — including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. — have joined in reversing those previous policies, leaving crypto matters at banks in the hands of their managers and compliance executives. In the absence of guidance, the banking industry awaits new laws from Congress to define how the digital assets industry should operate in the U.S. \"These actions ensure the Board's expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system,\" the Fed said in the Thursday statement announcing the change. Banking supervision of its state member banks is one of the multiple roles performed by the Fed, which is better known for its monetary policy work. The agency's move on Thursday will specifically remove four pieces of crypto guidance the board signed onto in 2022 and 2023, highlighting risks to banks posed by the sector. Fed officials \"will instead monitor banks' crypto-asset activities through the normal supervisory process.\" Read More: FDIC Reverses U.S. Crypto Banking Policy That Demanded Prior Approvals Jesse Hamilton is CoinDesk's deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

        "content": "Real estate tokenization—once a niche experiment—may soon become a core pillar of how property is financed, owned and traded, according to a Thursday report by Deloitte Center for Financial Services.The market of tokenized real estate could reach $4 trillion by 2035, growing at a compound annual rate of 27% from the current size of under $300 billion, the firm forecasted. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a red-hot sector at the intersection of crypto tech and traditional finance. It consists of creating digital versions of assets like bonds, funds and real estate, that represent ownerships on blockchain rails. The process offers operational efficiencies, cheaper and faster settlements and broader investor access. For the real estate sector, tokenization's appeal lies in its ability to automate and simplify complex financial agreements, the report explained, such as launching a real estate fund on-chain with coded rules handling ownership transfers and capital flows. An example for this is Kin Capital's $100 million real estate debt fund tokenization platform Chintai with trust-deed-based lending, Deloitte noted. The report outlines a three-pronged evolution of tokenized property: private real estate funds, securitized loan ownership, and under-construction or undeveloped land projects. Of these, tokenized debt securities are expected to dominate, hitting $2.39 trillion in value by 2035, based on the report's forecast. Private funds could contribute around $1 trillion, while land development assets may account for some $500 billion. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, the report noted, especially around regulation, asset custody, cybersecurity and default scenarios.

        "content": "El Salvador’s Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales (CNAD), the agency in charge of regulating digital assets in the Central American nation, is seeking to establish a cross-border regulatory sandbox with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “We want to create international collaboration,” Juan Carlos Reyes, president of the CNAD, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Our biggest message is that digital assets don’t have any geographical barriers. Collaboration with regulators should not have international barriers either.” El Salvador is in a unique situation in that it did not boast of strong financial institutions, or even of an existing ecosystem of developers, when President Nayib Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in 2021. That means the CNAD was able to start with a blank slate when it introduced a regulatory framework tailored to crypto. Almost two years later after Reyes took over the agency, El Salvador’s advanced regulatory framework has incentivized crypto giants such as Tether, Bitfinex and Binance to open shop in the country. The idea, Reyes said, is for the U.S. SEC to now use El Salvador as a live, real-world case study to evaluate streamlined regulatory approaches for digital assets — in other words, for the SEC to learn from El Salvador’s experience as it revamps its own regulatory framework in a post-Gensler world. The pilot program proposed by the CNAD involves different scenarios: a U.S.-licensed traditional finance broker obtaining a digital asset license under CNAD regulations, and the development of two small-scale tokenization offerings facilitated by a CNAD-licensed tokenization company. Each scenario would be capped at $10,000. These initiatives would support some of the objectives laid out by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in February, when she wrote that the SEC Crypto Task Force, which she now leads, would take a very different approach towards crypto regulation from here on out. “CNAD really looked at [Pierce’s document] with a critical eye as to how we can help,” Erica Perkin, owner of The Perkin Law Firm and a member of CNAD’s advisory group, told CoinDesk. “We’re here. There's data [the SEC] might want to collect. It's difficult to collect in the U.S. … We've built a framework that's nimble enough to work on the exact issues that the SEC is looking at, and we're here to help and collect information on how we can best do that.” The CNAD met with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 22 to discuss the initiative. The meeting was constructive, according to Reyes and Perkin. “They asked good questions,” Perkin said. “They're in an information-gathering phase. They were engaged and open to discussion.” Reyes has already signed regulatory cooperation agreements with countries such as Argentina and Paraguay. In his view, the SEC seems to be ahead of the curve when it comes to understanding the regulatory needs of digital assets, whereas regulators in other jurisdictions have tended to see crypto regulation from a traditional finance perspective. “The quality of people that make up the SEC Crypto Task Force is quite impressive. They get it. They understand the technology,” Reyes said. “We were able to have discussions that were on point about what’s needed in order to regulate the technology… It was very refreshing.” Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

        "content": "U.S. Senator Dave McCormick, the former chief executive of massive hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, is putting his own cash into bitcoin (BTC) as the committee he's on is at the tip of the spear for a legislative effort to regulate the digital assets industry. McCormick has made repeated recent investments in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to disclosures this week. Because of the ranges used in such lawmaker disclosures, the latest amounts invested last month can only be said to be between $310,000 and $700,000. The new investment follows McCormick's disclosure of as much as $450,000 in the Bitwise ETF in February, potentially bringing his total investment closer to a million. His investments represent the bulk of bitcoin investing in Congress this year. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, invested a much smaller amount, favoring BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The Republican senator from Pennsylvania, who has held a series of high-profile government posts throughout his career, is new to the Senate and was put on the Senate Banking's Committee's subcommittee that deals with digital assets. That's the group of lawmakers likely closest to the coming action on crypto legislation that's expected to move this year. As a Senate candidate last year, the former hedge fund exec argued America needed to lead on crypto. He said during the subcommittee's first digital assets hearing in February, \"This Congress must work alongside President Trump to pass bipartisan digital asset legislation that will guide the future of innovation and secure a robust economic future for the U.S.\" While his bitcoin stake is outpacing other lawmakers, he's been putting the bulk of his investments in municipal securities in recent months, the disclosures show.

        "content": "Japanese investment giant SoftBank is dipping its toes back into crypto by backing a new bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicle, Twenty One Capital, in conjunction with Tether, Bitfinex, and Cantor Fitzgerald. For some, the SoftBank Group—which has $308.7 billion assets under management—taking an interest in bitcoin is a welcome development and another sign of mounting institutional crypto adoption. After all, SoftBank functions more or less like a Japanese sovereign wealth fund, according to Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise. But for seasoned observers, it could be more of a déjà-vu than a breakthrough. Flashback to 2019, SoftBank made headlines when its founder, Masayoshi Son, took a gigantic loss on a personal bitcoin investment. Son had taken exposure to cryptocurrency in late 2017, when the ICO mania was at its peak and bitcoin was trading at an all-time high of around $20,000. With bitcoin now trading at $93,000, Son’s investment would have been very profitable had he held on. But he sold in early 2018 as bitcoin began to crash, resulting in a $130 million loss, according to the Wall Street Journal. So the question investors could be asking themselves now is, would this time be different?  To find a clue, let's take Oracle (ORCL) stock as an example. Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that SoftBank would be part of a $100 billion push to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. in conjunction with OpenAI and Oracle (ORCL).  One would say this is a bullish outcome for ORCL stock. However, since the announcement was made on Jan. 22, coinciding with ORCL topping at $188 per share, the stock fell 28%, while the Nasdaq has gone down 12% in the same period of time. Other outside factors, including macro headwinds and geopolitical tension, could explain the underperformance. It could also be just a plain coincidence. However, one analyst tied this Oracle selloff to Softbank's involvement in the AI infrastructure project. “When SoftBank enters an asset you own, you sell. I don't make the rules,” Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, wrote in a post on X, citing the Oracle pullback.

        "content": "Michael Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy had both believers and skeptics. But a new rival just emerged, already holding nearly $4 billion BTC on its balance sheet—and it's a bullish sign, according to at least one Wall Street analyst.   When SoftBank, Tether, and Cantor Fitzgerald unveiled plans to launch a new bitcoin investment company called Twenty One, structured explicitly around holding bitcoin as its primary business, many called it a significant rival to Saylor's Strategy (MSTR). Its day-one bitcoin balance sheet holding would rank it as the third-largest publicly held bitcoin treasury on day one. In traditional finance, one could argue that such a big competition could hamper a dominant company's market share and capital raise opportunities, especially since Twenty One is already potentially launching with over 42,000 BTC at launch (worth nearly $4 billion at spot price).  However, TD Cowen analysts Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete see it as the exact opposite: \"The proposed launch of Twenty One reflects the most-meaningful validation of Strategy's bitcoin treasury operations to date,\" leaving the analysts \"incrementally bullish\" on the stock.  The analysts added that the new rival could even convert MSTR's biggest skeptics, institutional investors, into believers in Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy. The move would also increase demand for bitcoin from a high-profile entrant, which could outweigh any pressure on Strategy’s cost of capital and attract more capital into buying bitcoin.  “Certainly this is what Michael Saylor professes to believe,” the analysts wrote, pointing to the Strategy founder’s long-standing push for more companies to adopt similar strategies. TD Cowen maintained its $550 price target for MSTR and projects the company could hold 757,000 BTC by the end of fiscal year 2027 — about 3.6% of bitcoin’s total supply. The analysts said that if bitcoin hits an average price of $170,000 by then, TD Cowen estimates that stash could be worth $129 billion. The bullish impact of this rivalry is already prominent in the market. The shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), Twenty One's SPAC vehicle, have already climbed as much as 130% since the announcement, while MSTR stocks held strong.

        "content": "Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said it will introduce free conversions between PayPal’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, and the U.S. currency in a move aimed at accelerating the shift toward on-chain payments. The move, open to both retail and institutional customers, is part of a partnership aimed at promoting PYUSD as a payment currency. Coinbase also plans to use its platform to offer PYUSD to PayPal’s extensive network of merchant partners, which could ease the use of stablecoins in everyday transactions. Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies, predominantly the dollar — are one of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto. They are marketed as a faster and cheaper alternative to legacy payment systems, and are increasingly popular for payments across borders. Standard Chartered projected the sector to grow to $2 trillion by 2028 from the current $220 billion. With regulation for stablecoins advancing in the U.S., the competition is heating up among issuers while banks and traditional payment firms are also eyeing the market. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, and Circle, issuer of the second largest dollar-backed stablecoin, have already linked up to use Circle's USDC as a trading pair and payment method. Circle introduced a remittances network this week. Market leader Tether, issuer of the $140 billion USDT, is mulling issuing a stablecoin designed for U.S. users. Meanwhile, PayPal, whose stablecoin debuted in 2023 and has grown to $860 million, recently introduced a 3.7% annual yield on PYUSD for U.S. token holders to attract more users.

        "content": "Shaquille O’Neal has reached a settlement agreement with a group of FTX investors who accused him of enabling the failed crypto exchange’s fraud by acting as a celebrity promoter, according to a court filing. Details of the settlement agreement, including the amount O’Neal will pay, have not yet been disclosed. Plaintiffs in the case are seeking up to $21 billion in total damages from O’Neal and other promoters, former executives and other insiders. The former basketball star-turned-business mogul was just one of a host of celebrity promoters named in the class action suit. Other athletes, including tennis player Naomi Osaka, baseball player Shohei Otani, basketball player Steph Curry and retired football player Tom Brady were also named as defendants, along with comedian Larry David, Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, and model Gisele Bundchen. Though O’Neal is the first big-name defendant in the case to settle on Wednesday, seven other celebrity promoters and former executives reached a settlement agreement with the investors back in 2023, including Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and Youtubers Tom Nash, Graham Stephan and Andrei Jikh. The first tranche of settlements were relatively small, totalling a collective $1.4 million. O’Neal’s settlement with FTX investors is not his first tied to a promotion of a failed crypto project. Last year, O’Neal and several of his associates agreed to pay $11 million to Astral non-fungible token (NFT) holders who lost money in the Solana-based project he founded and promoted.

        "link": "https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/04/24/stablecoin-legislation-must-ensure-financial-privacy",
        "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 15:32:06 +0000",
        "summary": "",
        "content": "Both the U.S. Senate and House are considering bills creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and all of the usual crypto-skeptic refrains have been sung, including the hymn that crypto is for crime. For instance, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) warned that the Senate’s GENIUS Act “will supercharge the financing of terrorism.” During debate on the House’s STABLE Act, Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) worried about the use of “unhosted wallets to evade” anti-money laundering provisions. Not surprisingly, both the GENIUS and STABLE Acts include significant sections on illicit finance, including subjecting stablecoin issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). But lawmakers must ensure that the bills’ anti-money laundering measures don’t open the door to unfettered financial surveillance of stablecoin users. Stablecoins are crypto tokens that are pegged to the value of another asset, like the U.S. dollar. The general idea is that the stable value of these tokens will promote their use as a digital medium of exchange. Stablecoins can be thought of both as an improvement to existing payment rails and as a way to bring the U.S. dollar “on-chain.” In other words, stablecoins are a 21st-century upgrade to cash. The Senate and the House have both advanced bills that would create a regulatory regime for “permitted stablecoin issuers” aimed, in part, at ensuring that stablecoins are, in fact, stable. But these days, conversations about the dollar, financial services, and crypto seem to go hand-in-hand with conversations about preventing illicit finance. The BSA requires financial institutions to help federal agencies detect and prevent money laundering and other crimes by, among other things, keeping records of transactions and filing reports with the government. Both the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act tackle illicit finance concerns by stating clearly that a permitted stablecoin issuer “shall be treated as a financial institution for the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act.” Designating a permitted stablecoin issuer as a financial institution is comparatively non-controversial. Putting aside the question of whether the BSA is a good (or constitutional) way to manage illicit finance risks, permitted stablecoin issuers look a lot like other entities, like banks and trust companies, that are already BSA financial institutions. But it’s not quite so simple. The BSA’s surveillance framework requires financial institutions to “know their customers” and to monitor transactions taking place through the institution. However, such surveillance does not extend to transactions that take place between individuals without the involvement of an institution. For example, the BSA doesn’t apply when cash changes hands between two people, allowing individuals to transact privately. While it’s infeasible to track cash transactions in the manner prescribed by the BSA, stablecoins can be tracked across a blockchain as they move between holders, even when the transfers happen between wallets that are unhosted by intermediaries. This characteristic is tempting to those who may want to extend BSA surveillance beyond its already expansive (and constitutionally infirm) boundaries. Fundamentally, digital asset transactions that are genuinely peer-to-peer should not be subject to greater government surveillance than peer-to-peer transactions in cash. Applying anti-money laundering provisions to unhosted wallets — which more closely resemble physical wallets holding cash than bank accounts — would be a massive expansion of financial surveillance and an unwelcome intrusion into the abilities of Americans to order their financial lives outside the eyes of the government. Both the GENIUS and STABLE Acts make clear — to varying degrees — that stablecoin issuers must have customer identification programs only for customers who either hold accounts “with the permitted payment stablecoin issuer” (GENIUS) or who are “initial holders” of a payment stablecoin (STABLE). But the other BSA requirements the bills would impose on stablecoin issuers, including maintaining anti-money laundering compliance programs, retention of records of stablecoin transactions, monitoring and reporting suspicious activity, are not so clearly limited. This leaves the door open to the imposition of broader surveillance requirements on stablecoin transactions that take place away from the issuer, which would be a major encroachment on Americans’ rights to transact privately. Fortunately, the sponsors of both bills seem to read the surveillance obligations narrowly. Representative Bryan Steil (R-WI), one of the sponsors of the STABLE Act, explained during the bill’s markup that requiring BSA surveillance of “every single self-hosted wallet” would “be a dramatic invasion of personal liberty” and that “Americans should not be treated the same as financial institutions.” And Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), one of the sponsors of the GENIUS Act, said during that bill’s markup that “[r]equiring issuers to monitor transactions on various blockchains would be costly and . . . time-consuming.” This sentiment about the scope of the BSA obligations imposed must be clearly reflected in the text of both bills to definitively close the door to more expansive future interpretations. Despite the characterizations by some skeptical members of Congress, preserving financial privacy is not simply a gift to criminals. Easy government access to financial information poses risks to everyone, particularly those with unpopular political views or anyone otherwise in the minority. Such surveillance is at odds with the rights of free people (including rights recognized in the U.S. Constitution) to live without unwarranted governmental monitoring. One step to ensuring that those rights are not further infringed is to guarantee that the stablecoin legislation under consideration unequivocally protects from surveillance stablecoin transactions occurring without a financial intermediary.

Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Crypto is no longer the “Wild West” of investing. Once dismissed as mere speculative bets, digital assets have matured into a credible and increasingly strategic component of institutional portfolios. Figure 1: Global assets under management (AUM) in physical crypto ETPs Source: Bloomberg, WisdomTree. 01 April 2025. Historical performance is not an indication of future performance and any investment may go down in value. As of the end of Q1 2025, global assets under management (AUM) in physical bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) was more than $100 billion. That figure signals deep, sustained conviction from institutional investors, meaning this is no longer just the realm of early adopters. Today, sovereign wealth funds, pension schemes and asset managers are allocating to crypto at scale. After more than 15 years of development, multiple boom-and-bust cycles and a global user base exceeding half a billion people, crypto has proven it is no passing trend. Bitcoin has emerged as a crypto macro asset — scarce, decentralized and increasingly positioned as a core holding within diversified multi-asset portfolios. But here’s the catch — crypto allocations are still under-diversified. Despite growing adoption, most crypto portfolios remain narrowly concentrated in bitcoin. That is a legacy mindset and one that is fundamentally flawed. Investors wouldn’t allocate their entire equity exposure to Apple, nor rely on a single bond to represent fixed income. Yet that is precisely how many still treat crypto. Diversification is foundational in traditional finance. It spreads risk, enhances resilience and unlocks access to broader opportunity sets. The same principle holds in digital assets. The cryptocurrency universe has expanded far beyond bitcoin, evolving into a dynamic ecosystem of distinct technologies, use cases and investment theses. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano are building decentralized infrastructure for everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), each with unique trade-offs in scalability, security and network design. Meanwhile, Polkadot is advancing interoperability, enabling seamless communication across chains — a key building block for a multi-chain future. Beyond these Layer 1 blockchains, we are seeing rapid innovation in: Each of these sectors carries its own risk-return profile, adoption curve and regulatory trajectory. Treating them as interchangeable, or worse, ignoring them altogether, is similar to reducing global equity investing to a single tech stock. It is not just outdated — it is strategically inefficient. Diversification in crypto is not about avoiding risk, but rather, capturing the full spectrum of innovation. In a multi-chain, multi-thesis world, failing to diversify means leaving opportunity on the table. The case for crypto indices The reality is that most investors do not have the time, tools or technical expertise to keep up with 24/7 crypto markets. Crypto indices offer a powerful solution for those seeking broad, systematic exposure without having to dive into tokenomics, validator uptime or network upgrades. Just as equity investors rely on benchmarks such as the S&P 500 or MSCI indices, diversified crypto indices allow investors to access the market passively — with scale, structure and simplicity. No guesswork, no token-picking, no need for constant rebalances. Just clean, rules-based exposure to the evolving crypto landscape. - Dovile Silenskyte, Director of Digital Assets Research, WisdomTree Q. Why is diversification important in crypto? A. Among over 20,000 listed cryptocurrencies, bitcoin now accounts for approximately 65% of total market capitalization. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Indices can be an efficient way of tracking asset class performance, while products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and separately managed accounts (SMAs) can provide exposure to multiple cryptocurrencies at once, potentially helping to spread risk.  Q. What trends are you seeing in digital assets? A. Institutional investors are entering the market, pushing digital assets from a niche investment into a key asset class. EY-Parthenon and Coinbase conducted a survey of more than 350 institutional investors around the world in January 2025. Of the investors surveyed, 87% plan to increase overall allocations to crypto in 2025, spanning a variety of options such as exchange-traded products (ETPs), investments in digital asset companies, stablecoins, futures and thematic mutual funds. Per the survey, 55% hold spot crypto through ETPs, with 69% of those who plan to own spot crypto planning to do so using registered vehicles. Q. Does a broad-based benchmark exist in crypto? A. There are broad benchmarks in digital assets. At CoinDesk Indices, we launched the CoinDesk 20 Index in January 2024, to capture the performance of top digital assets and act as a gateway to measure, trade and invest in the ever-expanding crypto asset class. Designed with liquidity and diversification in mind, the CoinDesk 20 has generated an unprecedented $14.5 billion in total trading volume and is available in twenty investment vehicles globally. CoinDesk Indices also has the CoinDesk 80 Index, CoinDesk 100 Index (CoinDesk 20 + CoinDesk 80) and CoinDesk Memecoin Index, amongst others. - Kim Klemballa, Head of Marketing, CoinDesk Indices Dovile Silenskyte is a director of digital assets research at WisdomTree.

        "content": "TON Foundation, the entity behind the Telegram-linked TON blockchain, has appointed Maximilian Crown, co-founder of MoonPay, as its CEO. Crown was the CFO and COO at the crypto infrastructure provider and has relationships with banks, payments companies, and regulatory bodies. He will remain on the board at MoonPay. The move comes one month after the TON Foundation announced that it had received $400 million worth of investment from venture capitalist firms that purchased the TON token. Active users on the TON blockchain jumped from 4 million to 41 million in the past year. However, the TON token, is down by 46% in the same period.  It aims to onboard 30% of Telegram's active users to the blockchain by 2028.  “TON’s speed, scalability, and exclusive integration with Telegram set it apart in the blockchain space,” said Maximilian Crown. “With access to over 1 billion Telegram users, TON has a unique opportunity to expand its ecosystem globally and redefine how blockchain technology is adopted at scale.\" Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. About Contact",

        "content": "With Canada's federal election less than one week away, Canadians are closely watching how political leaders intend to address digital assets. Millions of Canadians hold, use, or work in crypto, making it a growing focal point for economic growth and innovation. This politically prominent and growing community is shaping conversations about the future of finance, with voters signaling cautious openness, not to ban or ignore crypto, but to responsibly integrate it into Canada’s financial system with clear protections, accountability, and forward-looking policy.Dean Skurka is a speaker at Consensus 2025, in Toronto May 15, appearing with Kevin O'Leary on Mainstage.  Canada’s leadership in digital assets isn’t theoretical. It has evolved through first-of-its-kind milestones, homegrown innovation, and meaningful regulatory advancements, including: The pro-crypto voter base is large, diverse, informed, and engaged. According to a survey bu Nanos Research for the Canadian Web3 Council: This engaged voter base, the majority being under 50, represents a significant political force. The election and subsequent administration offer policymakers a chance to support voters’ eagerness for clarity around Canada's digital future. In 2022, the (pro-crypto) Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre made headlines for advocating financial freedom through Bitcoin and decentralized finance, calling for less control from politicians and bankers and more power in the hands of individuals. He said he wanted to make Canada “the blockchain capital of the world,” allowing people to “opt out” of inflation by using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Read more: Nik De - Previewing the Canadian Election's Crypto Angle By contrast, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, representing the Liberal Party, while supportive of digital innovation, remains skeptical of the idea that cryptocurrencies like stablecoins will fundamentally reshape the monetary system. He has argued that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) would be a safer, more stable foundation for digital money. \"Stablecoins are ultimately only an appendage to the conventional monetary system and not a game changer. CBDCs would reduce the risks of digital money and form the foundation of a more stable, programmable financial future,” he wrote in 2021. Meanwhile, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has openly criticized crypto’s volatility, citing the financial losses suffered by Canadians who bought into digital assets as a hedge against inflation. “We have a leader of the opposition who thinks he can magically opt out of inflation by buying cryptocurrency, which ended up tanking and hurting people,” he said in 2022. The successful candidate from this upcoming election has a chance to translate these varied views into coherent platform frameworks and enhance Canada’s position as a forward-thinking and tech-driven economy. The European Union has implemented the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, offering clear crypto regulations. The U.S. is playing catchup following the election of Donald Trump last November. The U.S. House Financial Services Committee has advanced the \"Stable Act of 2025,\" a significant step toward establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. And bipartisan efforts like the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act propose to exempt small crypto transactions under $200 from capital gains taxes. Congressional leaders are now working on a comprehensive “market structure” bill for crypto and regulators are open-minded about working with companies to adapt existing laws to modern needs. Canada is well-positioned to do the same. With the right policies, we can continue to attract leading talent, keep homegrown companies here, and strengthen our global voice in Web3. The choice is ours. Clarity on digital asset policy will affect how Canadians save, invest, and transact; whether new jobs and industries are built here or abroad; and whether our country will lead or follow in a rapidly emerging digital sector. Digital assets offer tangible benefits like faster, cheaper remittances for newcomers supporting families overseas, more accessible financial tools for underserved communities, and diversified investment alternatives in times of economic uncertainty. Beyond personal finance, blockchain technology has real potential to modernize Canada’s financial infrastructure, enhance anti-fraud efforts, and improve transparency in sectors like supply chain management and government services. The Canadian Web3 Council has called for integrating blockchain into Canada’s broader innovation strategy, urging federal support for talent development, funding, and the creation of a national blockchain strategy. They advocate for clear frameworks around decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoin regulation, and for Canada to take a leadership role in global digital asset policy conversations. The responsibility of highlighting crypto’s importance largely falls on the industry itself. Initiatives like Stand with Crypto Canada (a national advocacy campaign supported by WonderFi and nine other major companies) are actively educating voters and policymakers about the economic benefits of clear crypto regulation. Similarly, Blockchain North’s Voices for Canadian Crypto campaign, featuring prominent thought leaders, is helping unify industry voices, emphasizing the need for proactive policy conversations with leaders. We have talent. We have the infrastructure. And we have momentum. Now, we need leaders who see crypto not as a passing trend, but as a powerful opportunity to fuel Canada’s economy and empower a new generation of builders, investors, and innovators. The digital economy is here. The only question is: will Canada lead?

        "content": "CME Group is rolling out XRP futures on May 19th as it continues to expand its suite of cryptocurrency products, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, said in a press release. Pending regulatory approval, traders will be able to trade two contract sizes: 2,500 XRP and 50,000 XRP. The contracts will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which tracks XRP’s price daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. “As innovation in the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, market participants continue to look to regulated derivatives products to manage risks across a wider range of tokens,” Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, said.  “Interest in XRP and its underlying ledger (XRPL) has steadily increased as institutional and retail adoption for the network grows, and we are pleased to launch these new futures contracts to provide a capital-efficient toolset to support clients’ investment and hedging strategies.” The move comes after CME launched Solana (SOL) futures in March in addition to bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) futures and options which have been trading on the exchange for a while.

This latest move gives Tether Investments S.A. de C.V., the firm’s investment arm, 6.18% of voting rights. That cements Tether as a significant shareholder and hints at deeper involvement in the governance and financial future of one of Europe’s most storied sports institutions. Juventus, founded in 1897 and with 36 league titles to its name, is a major club in Italian and European football. Tether originally acquired an 8.2% stake in the club back in February. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino described the deal as more than a financial investment. “We believe Juventus is uniquely positioned to lead both on the field and in embracing technology that can elevate fan engagement, digital experiences, and financial resilience. We’re excited about the opportunities ahead,” Ardoino said. The company also expressed willingness to join future capital infusions to “help strengthen Juventus’s financial foundation and avoid dilution of its position. “ The stablecoin giant, which reported $13 billion in profit last year, has been investing in a number of sectors. These include artificial intelligence, bitcoin mining, and agriculture. Shares of Juventus are up more than 2.7% to 3.2 euros ($3.65) as of the time of writing.

        "content": "At a time when countless crypto projects are awkwardly pivoting toward artificial intelligence, Eric Winer has spent over a decade building bridges between cutting-edge technology and everyday users. Now, as CTO of NEAR AI, he's pursuing a vision where AI agents negotiate, communicate, and transact on our behalf — a vision that could fundamentally reshape how we interact with the digital world. Winer speaks with the measured enthusiasm of someone who has repeatedly been early to technological revolutions. Having joined the Winklevoss twins as Gemini's first engineer in 2013 and helped launch one of the earliest NFT marketplaces before the term \"NFT\" became commonplace, he now confronts what may be his most ambitious challenge: creating a decentralized ecosystem of AI agents that preserves user sovereignty in an increasingly AI-mediated future. Eric Winer is a speaker at Consensus 2025. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. CoinDesk: You've been in crypto for over a decade now. How did that journey lead you to focusing on AI? Eric Winer: I've been in the crypto world for 11 years now. Eleven years ago I met the Winklevoss twins through mutual acquaintances. They hired me as the first engineer at Gemini, which was the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in America at the time. Our mission from the CEO was to take this fantastic blockchain technology (really just Bitcoin at the time) and apply some grown-up engineering around it so that it could be effectively adopted by institutions, governments, and people broadly. Back in 2013-2014, Coinbase was around, but it was kind of a rinky-dink Silicon Valley startup at a time before there was really much of a fintech culture even in California. So it wasn't particularly built well. We were building Gemini in New York City with people who knew how money worked and trying to build not just for cryptography enthusiasts, but for the masses. I've always been trying to get blockchain technology over the adoption barrier to reach a place where people would be using it, perhaps under the hood, to make the world more efficient and give people more sovereignty, even if they don't know it. CoinDesk: And that led you to NFTs before most people had even heard the term, right? Eric Winer: Within Gemini, we acquired a company called Nifty Gateway, which was basically the third NFT startup after OpenSea and CryptoKitties. We launched what was the first NFT marketplace targeted at \"normies\" in March 2020. It ended up growing by about 1000% month over month for a few months, going from selling a thousand dollars of NFTs to selling a hundred million dollars of NFTs in a day. This exposed a lot of people to the world of collectibles and art online, right in the middle of the pandemic. From there they got bit by the NFT bug and then by the crypto bug, bringing them into the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. Personally, I think the promise of NFTs got unfortunately co-opted by the crypto and speculation crowd. Nifty Gateway never used the term \"NFT\" on its website or in its materials when it launched. We fought against that even becoming what it was called. NFT is just a thing, but online. We were selling art, selling tickets. Having to assign a technical moniker and put that into the public, I think, was actually counterproductive at the end of the day. CoinDesk: Many crypto projects seem to be awkwardly pivoting toward AI without a clear vision. What makes NEAR AI's approach different? Eric Winer: Near AI is a fascinating company because the founders of Near actually started by building an AI company. They started as an AI company, trying to train models to write code around 2017-2018. It was a little early for that to be effective at the time. AGI has always been the vision here. Near AI is less a \"crypto x AI\" company than it is an AI company that's vision-aligned with the same purpose of Near. Near's vision is for users to own their own data, own their own decision making, not be beholden to corporate, financial, or governmental interests, and be able to decide where their money goes and how their decisions are made. Whether that's done via a blockchain or done via an AI model, you have to have both. If we don't have a user-owned AI effort going, then we'll lose the game because everybody will start using ChatGPT for everything in their world, and whatever ChatGPT uses for payments is whatever you'll use for payments. Then blockchain loses because you didn't win the AI battle – not the crypto x AI battle, but the real actual AI battle. Near AI does have interactions with blockchains, including Near, because we think that Near and other blockchains are a good way of doing things. But we're primarily an AI company that sees crypto as a technology; we are not a crypto company trying to shove in AI. CoinDesk: What exactly does NEAR AI offer as a platform right now? Eric Winer: Near AI as it exists right now is mostly an agent hosting platform. It's actually one of the easiest ways to get an AI agent running online. You upload some pretty simple Python code or TypeScript code, and boom, it's hosted online with a user interface, embeddable into any website. It can be backed by any open weights models, although by and large, we delegate the actual model operation to other providers like Fireworks and Anthropic that are out there. The special sauce of our framework is that it makes it easy for those AI agents to talk to other AI agents, whether on our platform or off. The other thing that isn't live yet, but will be by the time consensus rolls around, is that we are heavily invested in TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments). We think it's very important that you know where your data is going, that it's not being harvested by these models for training, that even us as operators of a cloud system are not able to look at your data, analyze it, or steal it if we wanted. So we're putting all those agents and all the underlying models into these trusted execution environments so that you can use them with confidence. CoinDesk: Your vision seems to center on AI agents communicating with each other. What does that future look like to you? Eric Winer: What we're trying to build within Near AI is an ecosystem of AI agents that talk to each other. \"AI agent\" is a very overloaded term at this point. Most of the time when you see something talking about itself as an AI agent, it's really a set of guidelines and tools for an AI model to act on your behalf. Like, \"I've got Llama or Claude or GPT models, and I'm going to instruct it to post on Twitter on my behalf.\" To do that, it needs the ability to access Twitter and some general guidelines about how to read and post tweets. But that's not how I necessarily think about agents. I think about agents mostly in terms of how they interact with the rest of the world on your behalf. My AI agent is posting on Twitter, managing my calendar, looking at all my messages and emails, deciding which are spam, which to reply to, which to surface to me – just like an assistant in my life should be. The future that we envision, which I think is going to happen inevitably, is a world where most of our access to the internet and to the rest of the world is mediated by our personal AI assistants. CoinDesk: That's a remarkably different vision from most crypto projects. How does it reshape our financial systems? Eric Winer: If it's my AI agent talking to, say, Amazon's AI agent, and they're going to buy something and negotiate, they're more likely to rationally choose a crypto-based payment method and probably an AI-based dispute resolution method and AI-based credit. We reshape the financial system not by building a better one and trying to convince people to use it, but by building a better one and trying to convince AIs to use it that's easier for AIs and for the people operating them. I think that's the crypto adoption play now: we build a world of AIs talking to AIs on your behalf, and then we convince the AIs that blockchain and decentralization is a better world for them and for us than the one we've got. CoinDesk: So in your view, AI could actually be the catalyst that drives blockchain adoption, rather than the other way around? Eric Winer: I think in the future, and probably not too far in the future, you'll see that vision that everybody seems to want – the super app, the one place you go where everything you do online really becomes an AI assistant. It's giving you a content feed, it's taking action on your behalf, it's spending money on your behalf. And it's not just doing it alone. It's not just hitting APIs and browsing websites – it's talking to other AI agents. It's also handling your interpersonal, person-to-corporate, or person-to-governmental communications. That needs to be a decentralized ecosystem much like the internet is to some extent a decentralized system, but maybe we can do one better on top of blockchain-based registries.

        "content": "Crypto trading infrastructure startup, Theo, has raised a $20 million round co-led by Hack VC and Anthos Capital. Other participants included crypto-native firms and individual investors affiliated with traditional trading companies such as Citadel, Jane Street, and JPMorgan. Theo is developing a system that allows retail users to deposit digital assets into strategy-specific vaults, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. These vaults are designed to provide access to advanced trading strategies—including arbitrage, hedging, and cross-chain funding rate optimization—that are typically used by institutional players. The platform operates on a custom validator network that facilitates trade execution across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. It also enforces margin requirements and system-wide overcollateralization. The startup was founded by ex-Optiver and IMC quant traders Abhi Pingle, Arijit Pingle, and TK Kwon. “Today’s crypto markets are fragmented and inefficient, preventing institutions and everyday users alike from accessing the full promise of global, permissionless finance,” Abhi Pingle said. The press release notes that trading firms can use Theo’s infrastructure to improve capital efficiency by interacting with user-deposited funds, potentially increasing returns while managing execution and risk. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance. Before joining CoinDesk he worked at major financial and crypto publications. He owns bitcoin, ether, solana, and PAXG above CoinDesk's $1,000 disclosure threshold. About Contact",

        "content": "Polygon has launched the Agglayer Breakout Program to support projects building on the Agglayer and Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems in a boost for POL token stakers. The program combines incubation and community-focused funding to help founders develop and launch projects, with successful “graduates” airdropping 5%-15% of their native token supply to POL stakers and integrating with the Agglayer network. It provides hands-on support from Polygon Labs, funding, and access to ecosystem resources to help projects grow quickly and connect to Agglayer’s unified user base and liquidity. \"With the Agglayer Breakout Program, we’re setting the stage for massive ecosystem expansion—and that includes opportunities for POL, with the potential for huge airdrops and rewards flowing back to the community as these projects start growing with massive liquidity addition to Agglayer,\" said Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwa Agglayer, short for aggregation layer, can be thought of as a web of networks that seem like a single chain to a user. It relies on zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a type of cryptography that allows one party to prove a piece of information to another without sharing details. For example, one can prove to a blockchain that they have enough funds to pay another person without showing their wallet balance. The network verifies the payment, but financial details remain private. This is unlike regular blockchains or banking networks that reveal details. That makes it possible to build sophisticated financial and gaming applications, among others, that allow the building of a trustless ecosystem (as public details may attract threat actors). Among the first cohort of the breakout program is Privado ID, a ZK-based identity framework, which has fully graduated and plans to airdrop 5% of its token supply to POL stakers. Miden, a ZK-centric chain led by a former Facebook blockchain alum, is nearing graduation and will airdrop 10% of its tokens. A DeFi chain, still in stealth, is set to airdrop 15%. These Airdrops provide POL stakers with new tokens, increasing the utility of POL as more chains launch. Snapshots to determine airdrop eligibility will begin next week, and stakers can participate by staking POL as of Wednesday.

        "content": "Restaking protocol Ether.fi said it plans to add banking services that will see it become a decentralized finance (DeFi) neobank. The ether.fi app will give users the experience of a traditional fintech app, allowing them to spend, save and earn money through linked crypto features including restaking. The app will allow bill payments and payroll services using fiat money. \"With ether.fi we're bridging the gap between decentralized finance and everyday financial needs,\" CEO Mike Silagadze said in a statement. \"Our goal is to provide users with a robust, user-friendly platform that offers the benefits of DeFi without the complexities, making financial freedom accessible to everyone.\" One of the features under the hood will be ether.fi's cornerstone restaking product, which gives investors the opportunity to secure an additional yield by staking ether (ETH) and receiving liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that can be staked across the DeFi ecosystem. Last month CoinDesk reported on how Ether.fi was one of few restaking protocols that managed to retain total value locked (TVL) despite the sector suffering a drawdown in hype of the past year. It currently has 2.7 million ETH ($4.4 billion) in TVL, a near record high in ETH terms, according to DefiLlama. In September Ether.fi announced the release of its own Visa \"Cash\" card, which would allow cardholders to spend fiat currencies while using crypto as collateral.  This product, as well as the staking service, is now available in the U.S. despite both being previously ring-fenced due to regulatory requirements. It will initially be available in select states following a number of partnerships with local entities to ensure regulatory compliance.  Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. About Contact",

        "content": "Digital bank Revolut's profits surpassed 1 billion pounds ($1.33 billion) in 2024, thanks in part to a big jump in revenue from cryptocurrency trading. The London-based fintech group's wealth revenue increased 298% from 127.1 million pounds to just over 500 million pounds in the full year 2024. Revolut's wealth business includes cryptocurrency, commodities, trading, and savings products. Revolut also surpassed 50 million customers for the first time in 2024, with many of them possibly keen to dip their toe into cryptocurrency trading as the market boomed. Bitcoin (BTC) increased in price by over 120% during the calendar year, which was bookended by the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January and the election victory of the pro-crypto President Trump in November.  The fintech firm wasn't the sole benefactor of the crypto trading surge. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and popular trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) also said they saw a boost from crypto trading activities last year. Both firms are set to report their earnings in the next few weeks.  Across the business at large, Revolut's revenue also increased 72% from 1.8 billion pounds to over 3 billion. Profits before tax surpassed 1 billion pounds, following a nearly 150% increase compared to 2023.  Cryptocurrency has a track record of bolstering Revolut's earnings. The fintech's first annual profit came in 2021, another time customers were looking to cash in on a crypto bull market.

        "content": "Shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) surged 55% on Tuesday and are up an additional 15% in pre-market trading, trading below $19.  The skyward movement was driven by investor optimism around its proposed merger with Twenty One Capital a bitcoin (BTC) native investment vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank. Led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Brandon Lutnick, Twenty One Capital is being positioned as a public proxy for bitcoin, potentially holding over 42,000 BTC at launch and introducing metrics like Bitcoin Per Share (BPS) and Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR) to measure shareholder value in BTC terms. According to the latest pro forma ownership tables, Tether will control 42.8% of equity and 51.7% of voting power, while Bitfinex and SoftBank hold 16.0% and 24.0% of the company respectively, post-convert. Public SPAC shareholders will retain just 2.7% ownership, underscoring the extreme dilution but significant upside if BTC rises. With BTC trading near $94,000, and the entity holding nearly $4B in BTC exposure, investors are re-rating CEP as a high-leverage bet on institutional bitcoin adoption. The stock is set to re-list under ticker “XXI” once the merger is finalized.

        "content": "Zora's much-hyped ZORA token launch was meant to be a celebration — a \"fun\" moment for its community, and a supposed triumph for the tokenization of content creators everywhere, with strong demand expected for the Coinbase Ventures-backed project. Instead, it has turned into a familiar post-airdrop slog so far: A quick pop in price, followed by a slow bleed. The token, issued late Wednesday, is down more than 50% from a price spike following launch, continuing a grim pattern that has become all too common for tokens pushed by venture-backed projects. “Sold my $ZORA, thanks for playin,” wrote one trader, Faycytw, on X, summarizing the sentiment. They humorously posted images of deleting the Zora network and blocking its X profile - a jibe at users exiting most platforms after receiving token rewards. Sold my $ZORA, thanks for playin✅Now, here are 2 things to do pic.twitter.com/s98389toSx Zora’s pitch is that it’s a factory for tokenizing anything — tweets, memes, videos. Its sudden virality this week led to expectations of a game-changing token. Instead, ZORA came with no utility, no governance, and no roadmap beyond the phrase “a token for fun.” What it did have was on-chain liquidity (over $1.7 million) and listings on prominent exchanges, such as Binance Alpha, on the first day. Allocations were calculated based on a user’s activity on Zora, including but not limited to coining, minting, trading and referring. Last week, market watchers also perceived the rampant promotions and backing by senior Base network team members as contentious. Zora’s early price action makes it join the graveyard of tokens swiftly abandoned by fresh recipients, who felt they were being used as exit liquidity for better-connected insiders. “Traders have grown weary of holding altcoins as numerous high-profile and VC-backed projects try to attract new buyers by launching on exchanges with low liquidity,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message.  \"Market makers would pump prices after the listing, but the token price would later decline as vesting schedules created more selling pressure.” “n most cases, token use cases could not offset the selling pressure, as utilities were often limited to governance, discounts, subscriptions, or other low-buying-pressure services,” Ruck added. The pattern is what industry people call the “low float, high FDV” trap — where tokens are launched with sky-high fully diluted valuations but only a sliver of supply available for trading. Another qualm is transparency, where a sizable amount may be held by team members directly or indirectly. Another perfect example of why teams shouldn’t chase sky-high valuations pre-TGE:@zora raised at a 600M FDV.Being under pressure (understandably), $ZORA listed at 350M - and instantly dumped -50% to 175M.When will teams finally get it?List low.Create max upside.Let the… pic.twitter.com/xjkQrzXfpX “The $ZORA launch highlights a recurring issue in Web3: overpromising and underdelivering,” said Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto. “When a project markets itself as community-first but fails to communicate transparently — especially around something as sensitive as a token drop — it quickly erodes trust.” “Labeling the token ‘for fun’ with no utility only deepened the confusion and frustration,” Jung added. Online, some watchers indicate the sell-off is reflective of cautious market sentiment. ‘The fact that $zora is at $50m mcap on day 1 means we've made good progress,” well-followed trader CryptoKoryo said on X. “One year ago a VC funded project like that could have launched at maybe $500m, shilled by a big actor like Coinbase, when sentiment was bullish and prices going up.” The fact that $zora is at $50m mcap on day 1 means we've made good progress.one year ago a VC funded project like that could have launched at maybe $500m, shilled by a big actor like Coinbase, when sentiment was bullish and prices going up. pic.twitter.com/N6Mw8jJSmO Despite the backlash, Zora still holds significant clout in the creator crypto space. Its NFT minting protocol has seen solid adoption in the past week, metrics show, and both digital artists and brands have favored its platform. That’s not to say ZORA prices may not pick up in the coming days or weeks, especially as it trades around the 2-cent level as of Thursday morning at a relatively small $73 million market capitalization. Risk-takers could see short-term upside as the initial sell-off settles, and current valuations of a token linked to Coinbase and Base seem attractive. However, the no-utility nature of ZORA is reminiscent of lessons from the past: Tokens without substance rarely hold their shine for long.

        "content": "Americans reported a record $9.3 billion in losses to cryptocurrency-related crimes in 2024, according to a report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The losses represent a 66% jump from 2023 and highlight the growing use of digital assets in online fraud schemes. The annual IC3 report says nearly 150,000 complaints linked to crypto, with investment fraud leading the way. In these schemes, scammers often pretend to offer high returns on fake cryptocurrency platforms, coaxing victims to transfer funds that are then siphoned away. The FBI also spotlighted “pig butchering” scams, where fraudsters build online relationships before pushing fake crypto investments. Crypto investment schemes led to $5.8 billion in losses, while the second-largest category by losses at $1.1 billion were data breaches. Elderly Americans bore the brunt of the damage. Individuals over 60 reported $2.8 billion in losses through crypto-related crimes—more than any other age group— up from $1.65 billion in 2023 and $1.08 billion in 2022. The second-most affected age group, those aged 40-49, suffered $1.4 billion in losses, while those under the age of 40 suffered combined losses of around $1.37 billion. Over 8,000 of the complaints stemmed from people over 60 and related to fake investment opportunities, while others fell victim to tech support fraud and impersonation schemes, often involving cryptocurrency ATMs. Operation Level Up, a government initiative launched in January 2024, identified thousands of victims of crypto investment fraud and prevented an estimated $285 million in further losses, per the report. It referred 42 victims for suicide intervention. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

        "content": "Hit TV series Peaky Blinders, which reached an estimated audience of 80 million through platforms like Netflix, is set to be adapted into a blockchain-based video game and wider Web3 ecosystem, the companies behind the effort announced on Thursday. It is being developed by Anonymous Labs, a Web3 venture builder that previously launched the Simon’s Cat cartoon IP token. The company is partnering with Banijay Rights, the global distributor of Peaky Blinders, to expand the show’s presence into blockchain gaming and fan engagement tools. The smoky streets of 1920s England are reimagined as a decentralized playground where fans can dive into high-stakes missions, craft their own Shelby-style legacy (the family the series is based around), and engage with the Peaky Blinders universe. The game is being designed as an AAA title (a gaming buzzword where such products have extensive development budgets, large teams, and emphasis on high technical quality). It will feature digital collectibles and community engagement mechanisms that use blockchains. The goal is to onboard traditional Peaky Blinders fans into crypto through interactive storytelling and gameplay. \"Peaky Blinders is arguably the biggest IP to date to embark on building a blockchain-based project, and I see this as a defining moment for the entire Web3 industry,” Wojciech Gruszka, head of Development at Peaky Blinders Web3 Game, said in a statement. “This project is not just about creating an incredible user experience—it’s a gateway to bringing blockchain new revenue streams and building brand loyalty in the Web3 space,” Gruszka added. Specific details around token mechanics, launch timelines, or the game's economic structure have not been disclosed as of Thursday.

        "content": "Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is offering digital asset managers special accounts that allow pooling of their investors’ assets to make crypto fund management operations feel more like a traditional finance experience. The omnibus “Fund Accounts” introduce a universal net asset value (NAV) per unit concept used by buyside firms to provide a clear and trackable profit-and-loss for each fund, addressing the lack of a common market standard in crypto asset management, Binance said on Wednesday. Unlike the rarified world of high finance, crypto trading is still developing from a relatively unsophisticated retail market into a more institutional-friendly environment, a process that requires a transformation of infrastructure. “Asset management is a very mature and well established industry in TradFi,” said Binance head of institutional and VIP Catherine Chen in an interview. “In crypto, we think there's a lot of demand for this particular expertise and infrastructure because, for the time being, the entry barriers and the learning curve remains relatively steep.” There are pain points for both investors and managers, Chen said. For investors, trust is important, so using an established brand with clear proof of reserves and transparent NAV are key factors, she said. Eligible asset managers, who need to be licensed in their respective jurisdictions, no longer face such a heavy burden of admin and other operational tasks, and can create multiple fund accounts and deploy different trading strategies tailored to each fund. The expected size of asset managers likely to be attracted to Binance Fund Accounts could range from about $1 million assets under management (AUM) at the lower end, to around $20 million, Chen estimated. “It's gonna be a mixture. But obviously this type of infrastructure is really catering to those newer or smaller asset managers to bootstrap and properly scale the business,” she said.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve has joined its fellow U.S. banking regulators in deleting its crypto guidance of previous years, including notices that banks should get pre-approvals before they get involved in crypto activity. Now, all three agencies — including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. — have joined in reversing those previous policies, leaving crypto matters at banks in the hands of their managers and compliance executives. In the absence of guidance, the banking industry awaits new laws from Congress to define how the digital assets industry should operate in the U.S. \"These actions ensure the Board's expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system,\" the Fed said in the Thursday statement announcing the change. Banking supervision of its state member banks is one of the multiple roles performed by the Fed, which is better known for its monetary policy work. The agency's move on Thursday will specifically remove four pieces of crypto guidance the board signed onto in 2022 and 2023, highlighting risks to banks posed by the sector. Fed officials \"will instead monitor banks' crypto-asset activities through the normal supervisory process.\" Read More: FDIC Reverses U.S. Crypto Banking Policy That Demanded Prior Approvals Jesse Hamilton is CoinDesk's deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

        "content": "Real estate tokenization—once a niche experiment—may soon become a core pillar of how property is financed, owned and traded, according to a Thursday report by Deloitte Center for Financial Services.The market of tokenized real estate could reach $4 trillion by 2035, growing at a compound annual rate of 27% from the current size of under $300 billion, the firm forecasted. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a red-hot sector at the intersection of crypto tech and traditional finance. It consists of creating digital versions of assets like bonds, funds and real estate, that represent ownerships on blockchain rails. The process offers operational efficiencies, cheaper and faster settlements and broader investor access. For the real estate sector, tokenization's appeal lies in its ability to automate and simplify complex financial agreements, the report explained, such as launching a real estate fund on-chain with coded rules handling ownership transfers and capital flows. An example for this is Kin Capital's $100 million real estate debt fund tokenization platform Chintai with trust-deed-based lending, Deloitte noted. The report outlines a three-pronged evolution of tokenized property: private real estate funds, securitized loan ownership, and under-construction or undeveloped land projects. Of these, tokenized debt securities are expected to dominate, hitting $2.39 trillion in value by 2035, based on the report's forecast. Private funds could contribute around $1 trillion, while land development assets may account for some $500 billion. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, the report noted, especially around regulation, asset custody, cybersecurity and default scenarios.

        "content": "El Salvador’s Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales (CNAD), the agency in charge of regulating digital assets in the Central American nation, is seeking to establish a cross-border regulatory sandbox with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “We want to create international collaboration,” Juan Carlos Reyes, president of the CNAD, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Our biggest message is that digital assets don’t have any geographical barriers. Collaboration with regulators should not have international barriers either.” El Salvador is in a unique situation in that it did not boast of strong financial institutions, or even of an existing ecosystem of developers, when President Nayib Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in 2021. That means the CNAD was able to start with a blank slate when it introduced a regulatory framework tailored to crypto. Almost two years later after Reyes took over the agency, El Salvador’s advanced regulatory framework has incentivized crypto giants such as Tether, Bitfinex and Binance to open shop in the country. The idea, Reyes said, is for the U.S. SEC to now use El Salvador as a live, real-world case study to evaluate streamlined regulatory approaches for digital assets — in other words, for the SEC to learn from El Salvador’s experience as it revamps its own regulatory framework in a post-Gensler world. The pilot program proposed by the CNAD involves different scenarios: a U.S.-licensed traditional finance broker obtaining a digital asset license under CNAD regulations, and the development of two small-scale tokenization offerings facilitated by a CNAD-licensed tokenization company. Each scenario would be capped at $10,000. These initiatives would support some of the objectives laid out by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in February, when she wrote that the SEC Crypto Task Force, which she now leads, would take a very different approach towards crypto regulation from here on out. “CNAD really looked at [Pierce’s document] with a critical eye as to how we can help,” Erica Perkin, owner of The Perkin Law Firm and a member of CNAD’s advisory group, told CoinDesk. “We’re here. There's data [the SEC] might want to collect. It's difficult to collect in the U.S. … We've built a framework that's nimble enough to work on the exact issues that the SEC is looking at, and we're here to help and collect information on how we can best do that.” The CNAD met with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 22 to discuss the initiative. The meeting was constructive, according to Reyes and Perkin. “They asked good questions,” Perkin said. “They're in an information-gathering phase. They were engaged and open to discussion.” Reyes has already signed regulatory cooperation agreements with countries such as Argentina and Paraguay. In his view, the SEC seems to be ahead of the curve when it comes to understanding the regulatory needs of digital assets, whereas regulators in other jurisdictions have tended to see crypto regulation from a traditional finance perspective. “The quality of people that make up the SEC Crypto Task Force is quite impressive. They get it. They understand the technology,” Reyes said. “We were able to have discussions that were on point about what’s needed in order to regulate the technology… It was very refreshing.” Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America. He has a bachelor's degree in English literature from McGill University, and can usually be found in Costa Rica. He holds BTC above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000. About Contact",

        "content": "U.S. Senator Dave McCormick, the former chief executive of massive hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, is putting his own cash into bitcoin (BTC) as the committee he's on is at the tip of the spear for a legislative effort to regulate the digital assets industry. McCormick has made repeated recent investments in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to disclosures this week. Because of the ranges used in such lawmaker disclosures, the latest amounts invested last month can only be said to be between $310,000 and $700,000. The new investment follows McCormick's disclosure of as much as $450,000 in the Bitwise ETF in February, potentially bringing his total investment closer to a million. His investments represent the bulk of bitcoin investing in Congress this year. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, invested a much smaller amount, favoring BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The Republican senator from Pennsylvania, who has held a series of high-profile government posts throughout his career, is new to the Senate and was put on the Senate Banking's Committee's subcommittee that deals with digital assets. That's the group of lawmakers likely closest to the coming action on crypto legislation that's expected to move this year. As a Senate candidate last year, the former hedge fund exec argued America needed to lead on crypto. He said during the subcommittee's first digital assets hearing in February, \"This Congress must work alongside President Trump to pass bipartisan digital asset legislation that will guide the future of innovation and secure a robust economic future for the U.S.\" While his bitcoin stake is outpacing other lawmakers, he's been putting the bulk of his investments in municipal securities in recent months, the disclosures show.

        "link": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/24/softbank-is-buying-bitcoin-why-bulls-should-be-worried",
        "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:17:41 +0000",
        "summary": "",
        "content": "Japanese investment giant SoftBank is dipping its toes back into crypto by backing a new bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicle, Twenty One Capital, in conjunction with Tether, Bitfinex, and Cantor Fitzgerald. For some, the SoftBank Group—which has $308.7 billion assets under management—taking an interest in bitcoin is a welcome development and another sign of mounting institutional crypto adoption. After all, SoftBank functions more or less like a Japanese sovereign wealth fund, according to Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise. But for seasoned observers, it could be more of a déjà-vu than a breakthrough. Flashback to 2019, SoftBank made headlines when its founder, Masayoshi Son, took a gigantic loss on a personal bitcoin investment. Son had taken exposure to cryptocurrency in late 2017, when the ICO mania was at its peak and bitcoin was trading at an all-time high of around $20,000. With bitcoin now trading at $93,000, Son’s investment would have been very profitable had he held on. But he sold in early 2018 as bitcoin began to crash, resulting in a $130 million loss, according to the Wall Street Journal. So the question investors could be asking themselves now is, would this time be different?  To find a clue, let's take Oracle (ORCL) stock as an example. Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that SoftBank would be part of a $100 billion push to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. in conjunction with OpenAI and Oracle (ORCL).  One would say this is a bullish outcome for ORCL stock. However, since the announcement was made on Jan. 22, coinciding with ORCL topping at $188 per share, the stock fell 28%, while the Nasdaq has gone down 12% in the same period of time. Other outside factors, including macro headwinds and geopolitical tension, could explain the underperformance. It could also be just a plain coincidence. However, one analyst tied this Oracle selloff to Softbank's involvement in the AI infrastructure project. “When SoftBank enters an asset you own, you sell. I don't make the rules,” Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, wrote in a post on X, citing the Oracle pullback.

        "content": "Michael Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy had both believers and skeptics. But a new rival just emerged, already holding nearly $4 billion BTC on its balance sheet—and it's a bullish sign, according to at least one Wall Street analyst.   When SoftBank, Tether, and Cantor Fitzgerald unveiled plans to launch a new bitcoin investment company called Twenty One, structured explicitly around holding bitcoin as its primary business, many called it a significant rival to Saylor's Strategy (MSTR). Its day-one bitcoin balance sheet holding would rank it as the third-largest publicly held bitcoin treasury on day one. In traditional finance, one could argue that such a big competition could hamper a dominant company's market share and capital raise opportunities, especially since Twenty One is already potentially launching with over 42,000 BTC at launch (worth nearly $4 billion at spot price).  However, TD Cowen analysts Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete see it as the exact opposite: \"The proposed launch of Twenty One reflects the most-meaningful validation of Strategy's bitcoin treasury operations to date,\" leaving the analysts \"incrementally bullish\" on the stock.  The analysts added that the new rival could even convert MSTR's biggest skeptics, institutional investors, into believers in Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy. The move would also increase demand for bitcoin from a high-profile entrant, which could outweigh any pressure on Strategy’s cost of capital and attract more capital into buying bitcoin.  “Certainly this is what Michael Saylor professes to believe,” the analysts wrote, pointing to the Strategy founder’s long-standing push for more companies to adopt similar strategies. TD Cowen maintained its $550 price target for MSTR and projects the company could hold 757,000 BTC by the end of fiscal year 2027 — about 3.6% of bitcoin’s total supply. The analysts said that if bitcoin hits an average price of $170,000 by then, TD Cowen estimates that stash could be worth $129 billion. The bullish impact of this rivalry is already prominent in the market. The shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), Twenty One's SPAC vehicle, have already climbed as much as 130% since the announcement, while MSTR stocks held strong.

        "content": "Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said it will introduce free conversions between PayPal’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, and the U.S. currency in a move aimed at accelerating the shift toward on-chain payments. The move, open to both retail and institutional customers, is part of a partnership aimed at promoting PYUSD as a payment currency. Coinbase also plans to use its platform to offer PYUSD to PayPal’s extensive network of merchant partners, which could ease the use of stablecoins in everyday transactions. Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies, predominantly the dollar — are one of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto. They are marketed as a faster and cheaper alternative to legacy payment systems, and are increasingly popular for payments across borders. Standard Chartered projected the sector to grow to $2 trillion by 2028 from the current $220 billion. With regulation for stablecoins advancing in the U.S., the competition is heating up among issuers while banks and traditional payment firms are also eyeing the market. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, and Circle, issuer of the second largest dollar-backed stablecoin, have already linked up to use Circle's USDC as a trading pair and payment method. Circle introduced a remittances network this week. Market leader Tether, issuer of the $140 billion USDT, is mulling issuing a stablecoin designed for U.S. users. Meanwhile, PayPal, whose stablecoin debuted in 2023 and has grown to $860 million, recently introduced a 3.7% annual yield on PYUSD for U.S. token holders to attract more users.

        "content": "Shaquille O’Neal has reached a settlement agreement with a group of FTX investors who accused him of enabling the failed crypto exchange’s fraud by acting as a celebrity promoter, according to a court filing. Details of the settlement agreement, including the amount O’Neal will pay, have not yet been disclosed. Plaintiffs in the case are seeking up to $21 billion in total damages from O’Neal and other promoters, former executives and other insiders. The former basketball star-turned-business mogul was just one of a host of celebrity promoters named in the class action suit. Other athletes, including tennis player Naomi Osaka, baseball player Shohei Otani, basketball player Steph Curry and retired football player Tom Brady were also named as defendants, along with comedian Larry David, Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, and model Gisele Bundchen. Though O’Neal is the first big-name defendant in the case to settle on Wednesday, seven other celebrity promoters and former executives reached a settlement agreement with the investors back in 2023, including Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and Youtubers Tom Nash, Graham Stephan and Andrei Jikh. The first tranche of settlements were relatively small, totalling a collective $1.4 million. O’Neal’s settlement with FTX investors is not his first tied to a promotion of a failed crypto project. Last year, O’Neal and several of his associates agreed to pay $11 million to Astral non-fungible token (NFT) holders who lost money in the Solana-based project he founded and promoted.

        "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 15:32:06 +0000",
        "summary": "",
        "content": "Both the U.S. Senate and House are considering bills creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and all of the usual crypto-skeptic refrains have been sung, including the hymn that crypto is for crime. For instance, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) warned that the Senate’s GENIUS Act “will supercharge the financing of terrorism.” During debate on the House’s STABLE Act, Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) worried about the use of “unhosted wallets to evade” anti-money laundering provisions. Not surprisingly, both the GENIUS and STABLE Acts include significant sections on illicit finance, including subjecting stablecoin issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). But lawmakers must ensure that the bills’ anti-money laundering measures don’t open the door to unfettered financial surveillance of stablecoin users. Stablecoins are crypto tokens that are pegged to the value of another asset, like the U.S. dollar. The general idea is that the stable value of these tokens will promote their use as a digital medium of exchange. Stablecoins can be thought of both as an improvement to existing payment rails and as a way to bring the U.S. dollar “on-chain.” In other words, stablecoins are a 21st-century upgrade to cash. The Senate and the House have both advanced bills that would create a regulatory regime for “permitted stablecoin issuers” aimed, in part, at ensuring that stablecoins are, in fact, stable. But these days, conversations about the dollar, financial services, and crypto seem to go hand-in-hand with conversations about preventing illicit finance. The BSA requires financial institutions to help federal agencies detect and prevent money laundering and other crimes by, among other things, keeping records of transactions and filing reports with the government. Both the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act tackle illicit finance concerns by stating clearly that a permitted stablecoin issuer “shall be treated as a financial institution for the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act.” Designating a permitted stablecoin issuer as a financial institution is comparatively non-controversial. Putting aside the question of whether the BSA is a good (or constitutional) way to manage illicit finance risks, permitted stablecoin issuers look a lot like other entities, like banks and trust companies, that are already BSA financial institutions. But it’s not quite so simple. The BSA’s surveillance framework requires financial institutions to “know their customers” and to monitor transactions taking place through the institution. However, such surveillance does not extend to transactions that take place between individuals without the involvement of an institution. For example, the BSA doesn’t apply when cash changes hands between two people, allowing individuals to transact privately. While it’s infeasible to track cash transactions in the manner prescribed by the BSA, stablecoins can be tracked across a blockchain as they move between holders, even when the transfers happen between wallets that are unhosted by intermediaries. This characteristic is tempting to those who may want to extend BSA surveillance beyond its already expansive (and constitutionally infirm) boundaries. Fundamentally, digital asset transactions that are genuinely peer-to-peer should not be subject to greater government surveillance than peer-to-peer transactions in cash. Applying anti-money laundering provisions to unhosted wallets — which more closely resemble physical wallets holding cash than bank accounts — would be a massive expansion of financial surveillance and an unwelcome intrusion into the abilities of Americans to order their financial lives outside the eyes of the government. Both the GENIUS and STABLE Acts make clear — to varying degrees — that stablecoin issuers must have customer identification programs only for customers who either hold accounts “with the permitted payment stablecoin issuer” (GENIUS) or who are “initial holders” of a payment stablecoin (STABLE). But the other BSA requirements the bills would impose on stablecoin issuers, including maintaining anti-money laundering compliance programs, retention of records of stablecoin transactions, monitoring and reporting suspicious activity, are not so clearly limited. This leaves the door open to the imposition of broader surveillance requirements on stablecoin transactions that take place away from the issuer, which would be a major encroachment on Americans’ rights to transact privately. Fortunately, the sponsors of both bills seem to read the surveillance obligations narrowly. Representative Bryan Steil (R-WI), one of the sponsors of the STABLE Act, explained during the bill’s markup that requiring BSA surveillance of “every single self-hosted wallet” would “be a dramatic invasion of personal liberty” and that “Americans should not be treated the same as financial institutions.” And Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), one of the sponsors of the GENIUS Act, said during that bill’s markup that “[r]equiring issuers to monitor transactions on various blockchains would be costly and . . . time-consuming.” This sentiment about the scope of the BSA obligations imposed must be clearly reflected in the text of both bills to definitively close the door to more expansive future interpretations. Despite the characterizations by some skeptical members of Congress, preserving financial privacy is not simply a gift to criminals. Easy government access to financial information poses risks to everyone, particularly those with unpopular political views or anyone otherwise in the minority. Such surveillance is at odds with the rights of free people (including rights recognized in the U.S. Constitution) to live without unwarranted governmental monitoring. One step to ensuring that those rights are not further infringed is to guarantee that the stablecoin legislation under consideration unequivocally protects from surveillance stablecoin transactions occurring without a financial intermediary.

Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Crypto is no longer the “Wild West” of investing. Once dismissed as mere speculative bets, digital assets have matured into a credible and increasingly strategic component of institutional portfolios. Figure 1: Global assets under management (AUM) in physical crypto ETPs Source: Bloomberg, WisdomTree. 01 April 2025. Historical performance is not an indication of future performance and any investment may go down in value. As of the end of Q1 2025, global assets under management (AUM) in physical bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) was more than $100 billion. That figure signals deep, sustained conviction from institutional investors, meaning this is no longer just the realm of early adopters. Today, sovereign wealth funds, pension schemes and asset managers are allocating to crypto at scale. After more than 15 years of development, multiple boom-and-bust cycles and a global user base exceeding half a billion people, crypto has proven it is no passing trend. Bitcoin has emerged as a crypto macro asset — scarce, decentralized and increasingly positioned as a core holding within diversified multi-asset portfolios. But here’s the catch — crypto allocations are still under-diversified. Despite growing adoption, most crypto portfolios remain narrowly concentrated in bitcoin. That is a legacy mindset and one that is fundamentally flawed. Investors wouldn’t allocate their entire equity exposure to Apple, nor rely on a single bond to represent fixed income. Yet that is precisely how many still treat crypto. Diversification is foundational in traditional finance. It spreads risk, enhances resilience and unlocks access to broader opportunity sets. The same principle holds in digital assets. The cryptocurrency universe has expanded far beyond bitcoin, evolving into a dynamic ecosystem of distinct technologies, use cases and investment theses. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano are building decentralized infrastructure for everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), each with unique trade-offs in scalability, security and network design. Meanwhile, Polkadot is advancing interoperability, enabling seamless communication across chains — a key building block for a multi-chain future. Beyond these Layer 1 blockchains, we are seeing rapid innovation in: Each of these sectors carries its own risk-return profile, adoption curve and regulatory trajectory. Treating them as interchangeable, or worse, ignoring them altogether, is similar to reducing global equity investing to a single tech stock. It is not just outdated — it is strategically inefficient. Diversification in crypto is not about avoiding risk, but rather, capturing the full spectrum of innovation. In a multi-chain, multi-thesis world, failing to diversify means leaving opportunity on the table. The case for crypto indices The reality is that most investors do not have the time, tools or technical expertise to keep up with 24/7 crypto markets. Crypto indices offer a powerful solution for those seeking broad, systematic exposure without having to dive into tokenomics, validator uptime or network upgrades. Just as equity investors rely on benchmarks such as the S&P 500 or MSCI indices, diversified crypto indices allow investors to access the market passively — with scale, structure and simplicity. No guesswork, no token-picking, no need for constant rebalances. Just clean, rules-based exposure to the evolving crypto landscape. - Dovile Silenskyte, Director of Digital Assets Research, WisdomTree Q. Why is diversification important in crypto? A. Among over 20,000 listed cryptocurrencies, bitcoin now accounts for approximately 65% of total market capitalization. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Indices can be an efficient way of tracking asset class performance, while products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and separately managed accounts (SMAs) can provide exposure to multiple cryptocurrencies at once, potentially helping to spread risk.  Q. What trends are you seeing in digital assets? A. Institutional investors are entering the market, pushing digital assets from a niche investment into a key asset class. EY-Parthenon and Coinbase conducted a survey of more than 350 institutional investors around the world in January 2025. Of the investors surveyed, 87% plan to increase overall allocations to crypto in 2025, spanning a variety of options such as exchange-traded products (ETPs), investments in digital asset companies, stablecoins, futures and thematic mutual funds. Per the survey, 55% hold spot crypto through ETPs, with 69% of those who plan to own spot crypto planning to do so using registered vehicles. Q. Does a broad-based benchmark exist in crypto? A. There are broad benchmarks in digital assets. At CoinDesk Indices, we launched the CoinDesk 20 Index in January 2024, to capture the performance of top digital assets and act as a gateway to measure, trade and invest in the ever-expanding crypto asset class. Designed with liquidity and diversification in mind, the CoinDesk 20 has generated an unprecedented $14.5 billion in total trading volume and is available in twenty investment vehicles globally. CoinDesk Indices also has the CoinDesk 80 Index, CoinDesk 100 Index (CoinDesk 20 + CoinDesk 80) and CoinDesk Memecoin Index, amongst others. - Kim Klemballa, Head of Marketing, CoinDesk Indices Dovile Silenskyte is a director of digital assets research at WisdomTree.

        "content": "TON Foundation, the entity behind the Telegram-linked TON blockchain, has appointed Maximilian Crown, co-founder of MoonPay, as its CEO. Crown was the CFO and COO at the crypto infrastructure provider and has relationships with banks, payments companies, and regulatory bodies. He will remain on the board at MoonPay. The move comes one month after the TON Foundation announced that it had received $400 million worth of investment from venture capitalist firms that purchased the TON token. Active users on the TON blockchain jumped from 4 million to 41 million in the past year. However, the TON token, is down by 46% in the same period.  It aims to onboard 30% of Telegram's active users to the blockchain by 2028.  “TON’s speed, scalability, and exclusive integration with Telegram set it apart in the blockchain space,” said Maximilian Crown. “With access to over 1 billion Telegram users, TON has a unique opportunity to expand its ecosystem globally and redefine how blockchain technology is adopted at scale.\" Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. About Contact",

        "content": "With Canada's federal election less than one week away, Canadians are closely watching how political leaders intend to address digital assets. Millions of Canadians hold, use, or work in crypto, making it a growing focal point for economic growth and innovation. This politically prominent and growing community is shaping conversations about the future of finance, with voters signaling cautious openness, not to ban or ignore crypto, but to responsibly integrate it into Canada’s financial system with clear protections, accountability, and forward-looking policy.Dean Skurka is a speaker at Consensus 2025, in Toronto May 15, appearing with Kevin O'Leary on Mainstage.  Canada’s leadership in digital assets isn’t theoretical. It has evolved through first-of-its-kind milestones, homegrown innovation, and meaningful regulatory advancements, including: The pro-crypto voter base is large, diverse, informed, and engaged. According to a survey bu Nanos Research for the Canadian Web3 Council: This engaged voter base, the majority being under 50, represents a significant political force. The election and subsequent administration offer policymakers a chance to support voters’ eagerness for clarity around Canada's digital future. In 2022, the (pro-crypto) Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre made headlines for advocating financial freedom through Bitcoin and decentralized finance, calling for less control from politicians and bankers and more power in the hands of individuals. He said he wanted to make Canada “the blockchain capital of the world,” allowing people to “opt out” of inflation by using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Read more: Nik De - Previewing the Canadian Election's Crypto Angle By contrast, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, representing the Liberal Party, while supportive of digital innovation, remains skeptical of the idea that cryptocurrencies like stablecoins will fundamentally reshape the monetary system. He has argued that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) would be a safer, more stable foundation for digital money. \"Stablecoins are ultimately only an appendage to the conventional monetary system and not a game changer. CBDCs would reduce the risks of digital money and form the foundation of a more stable, programmable financial future,” he wrote in 2021. Meanwhile, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has openly criticized crypto’s volatility, citing the financial losses suffered by Canadians who bought into digital assets as a hedge against inflation. “We have a leader of the opposition who thinks he can magically opt out of inflation by buying cryptocurrency, which ended up tanking and hurting people,” he said in 2022. The successful candidate from this upcoming election has a chance to translate these varied views into coherent platform frameworks and enhance Canada’s position as a forward-thinking and tech-driven economy. The European Union has implemented the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, offering clear crypto regulations. The U.S. is playing catchup following the election of Donald Trump last November. The U.S. House Financial Services Committee has advanced the \"Stable Act of 2025,\" a significant step toward establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. And bipartisan efforts like the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act propose to exempt small crypto transactions under $200 from capital gains taxes. Congressional leaders are now working on a comprehensive “market structure” bill for crypto and regulators are open-minded about working with companies to adapt existing laws to modern needs. Canada is well-positioned to do the same. With the right policies, we can continue to attract leading talent, keep homegrown companies here, and strengthen our global voice in Web3. The choice is ours. Clarity on digital asset policy will affect how Canadians save, invest, and transact; whether new jobs and industries are built here or abroad; and whether our country will lead or follow in a rapidly emerging digital sector. Digital assets offer tangible benefits like faster, cheaper remittances for newcomers supporting families overseas, more accessible financial tools for underserved communities, and diversified investment alternatives in times of economic uncertainty. Beyond personal finance, blockchain technology has real potential to modernize Canada’s financial infrastructure, enhance anti-fraud efforts, and improve transparency in sectors like supply chain management and government services. The Canadian Web3 Council has called for integrating blockchain into Canada’s broader innovation strategy, urging federal support for talent development, funding, and the creation of a national blockchain strategy. They advocate for clear frameworks around decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoin regulation, and for Canada to take a leadership role in global digital asset policy conversations. The responsibility of highlighting crypto’s importance largely falls on the industry itself. Initiatives like Stand with Crypto Canada (a national advocacy campaign supported by WonderFi and nine other major companies) are actively educating voters and policymakers about the economic benefits of clear crypto regulation. Similarly, Blockchain North’s Voices for Canadian Crypto campaign, featuring prominent thought leaders, is helping unify industry voices, emphasizing the need for proactive policy conversations with leaders. We have talent. We have the infrastructure. And we have momentum. Now, we need leaders who see crypto not as a passing trend, but as a powerful opportunity to fuel Canada’s economy and empower a new generation of builders, investors, and innovators. The digital economy is here. The only question is: will Canada lead?

        "content": "CME Group is rolling out XRP futures on May 19th as it continues to expand its suite of cryptocurrency products, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, said in a press release. Pending regulatory approval, traders will be able to trade two contract sizes: 2,500 XRP and 50,000 XRP. The contracts will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which tracks XRP’s price daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. “As innovation in the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, market participants continue to look to regulated derivatives products to manage risks across a wider range of tokens,” Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, said.  “Interest in XRP and its underlying ledger (XRPL) has steadily increased as institutional and retail adoption for the network grows, and we are pleased to launch these new futures contracts to provide a capital-efficient toolset to support clients’ investment and hedging strategies.” The move comes after CME launched Solana (SOL) futures in March in addition to bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) futures and options which have been trading on the exchange for a while.

        "content": "Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has raised its stake in the Juventus Football Club to over 10% after expanding its stake in the Italian giant earlier this month. This latest move gives Tether Investments S.A. de C.V., the firm’s investment arm, 6.18% of voting rights. That cements Tether as a significant shareholder and hints at deeper involvement in the governance and financial future of one of Europe’s most storied sports institutions. Juventus, founded in 1897 and with 36 league titles to its name, is a major club in Italian and European football. Tether originally acquired an 8.2% stake in the club back in February. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino described the deal as more than a financial investment. “We believe Juventus is uniquely positioned to lead both on the field and in embracing technology that can elevate fan engagement, digital experiences, and financial resilience. We’re excited about the opportunities ahead,” Ardoino said. The company also expressed willingness to join future capital infusions to “help strengthen Juventus’s financial foundation and avoid dilution of its position. “ The stablecoin giant, which reported $13 billion in profit last year, has been investing in a number of sectors. These include artificial intelligence, bitcoin mining, and agriculture. Shares of Juventus are up more than 2.7% to 3.2 euros ($3.65) as of the time of writing.

        "summary": "",
        "content": "At a time when countless crypto projects are awkwardly pivoting toward artificial intelligence, Eric Winer has spent over a decade building bridges between cutting-edge technology and everyday users. Now, as CTO of NEAR AI, he's pursuing a vision where AI agents negotiate, communicate, and transact on our behalf — a vision that could fundamentally reshape how we interact with the digital world. Winer speaks with the measured enthusiasm of someone who has repeatedly been early to technological revolutions. Having joined the Winklevoss twins as Gemini's first engineer in 2013 and helped launch one of the earliest NFT marketplaces before the term \"NFT\" became commonplace, he now confronts what may be his most ambitious challenge: creating a decentralized ecosystem of AI agents that preserves user sovereignty in an increasingly AI-mediated future. Eric Winer is a speaker at Consensus 2025. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. CoinDesk: You've been in crypto for over a decade now. How did that journey lead you to focusing on AI? Eric Winer: I've been in the crypto world for 11 years now. Eleven years ago I met the Winklevoss twins through mutual acquaintances. They hired me as the first engineer at Gemini, which was the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in America at the time. Our mission from the CEO was to take this fantastic blockchain technology (really just Bitcoin at the time) and apply some grown-up engineering around it so that it could be effectively adopted by institutions, governments, and people broadly. Back in 2013-2014, Coinbase was around, but it was kind of a rinky-dink Silicon Valley startup at a time before there was really much of a fintech culture even in California. So it wasn't particularly built well. We were building Gemini in New York City with people who knew how money worked and trying to build not just for cryptography enthusiasts, but for the masses. I've always been trying to get blockchain technology over the adoption barrier to reach a place where people would be using it, perhaps under the hood, to make the world more efficient and give people more sovereignty, even if they don't know it. CoinDesk: And that led you to NFTs before most people had even heard the term, right? Eric Winer: Within Gemini, we acquired a company called Nifty Gateway, which was basically the third NFT startup after OpenSea and CryptoKitties. We launched what was the first NFT marketplace targeted at \"normies\" in March 2020. It ended up growing by about 1000% month over month for a few months, going from selling a thousand dollars of NFTs to selling a hundred million dollars of NFTs in a day. This exposed a lot of people to the world of collectibles and art online, right in the middle of the pandemic. From there they got bit by the NFT bug and then by the crypto bug, bringing them into the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. Personally, I think the promise of NFTs got unfortunately co-opted by the crypto and speculation crowd. Nifty Gateway never used the term \"NFT\" on its website or in its materials when it launched. We fought against that even becoming what it was called. NFT is just a thing, but online. We were selling art, selling tickets. Having to assign a technical moniker and put that into the public, I think, was actually counterproductive at the end of the day. CoinDesk: Many crypto projects seem to be awkwardly pivoting toward AI without a clear vision. What makes NEAR AI's approach different? Eric Winer: Near AI is a fascinating company because the founders of Near actually started by building an AI company. They started as an AI company, trying to train models to write code around 2017-2018. It was a little early for that to be effective at the time. AGI has always been the vision here. Near AI is less a \"crypto x AI\" company than it is an AI company that's vision-aligned with the same purpose of Near. Near's vision is for users to own their own data, own their own decision making, not be beholden to corporate, financial, or governmental interests, and be able to decide where their money goes and how their decisions are made. Whether that's done via a blockchain or done via an AI model, you have to have both. If we don't have a user-owned AI effort going, then we'll lose the game because everybody will start using ChatGPT for everything in their world, and whatever ChatGPT uses for payments is whatever you'll use for payments. Then blockchain loses because you didn't win the AI battle – not the crypto x AI battle, but the real actual AI battle. Near AI does have interactions with blockchains, including Near, because we think that Near and other blockchains are a good way of doing things. But we're primarily an AI company that sees crypto as a technology; we are not a crypto company trying to shove in AI. CoinDesk: What exactly does NEAR AI offer as a platform right now? Eric Winer: Near AI as it exists right now is mostly an agent hosting platform. It's actually one of the easiest ways to get an AI agent running online. You upload some pretty simple Python code or TypeScript code, and boom, it's hosted online with a user interface, embeddable into any website. It can be backed by any open weights models, although by and large, we delegate the actual model operation to other providers like Fireworks and Anthropic that are out there. The special sauce of our framework is that it makes it easy for those AI agents to talk to other AI agents, whether on our platform or off. The other thing that isn't live yet, but will be by the time consensus rolls around, is that we are heavily invested in TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments). We think it's very important that you know where your data is going, that it's not being harvested by these models for training, that even us as operators of a cloud system are not able to look at your data, analyze it, or steal it if we wanted. So we're putting all those agents and all the underlying models into these trusted execution environments so that you can use them with confidence. CoinDesk: Your vision seems to center on AI agents communicating with each other. What does that future look like to you? Eric Winer: What we're trying to build within Near AI is an ecosystem of AI agents that talk to each other. \"AI agent\" is a very overloaded term at this point. Most of the time when you see something talking about itself as an AI agent, it's really a set of guidelines and tools for an AI model to act on your behalf. Like, \"I've got Llama or Claude or GPT models, and I'm going to instruct it to post on Twitter on my behalf.\" To do that, it needs the ability to access Twitter and some general guidelines about how to read and post tweets. But that's not how I necessarily think about agents. I think about agents mostly in terms of how they interact with the rest of the world on your behalf. My AI agent is posting on Twitter, managing my calendar, looking at all my messages and emails, deciding which are spam, which to reply to, which to surface to me – just like an assistant in my life should be. The future that we envision, which I think is going to happen inevitably, is a world where most of our access to the internet and to the rest of the world is mediated by our personal AI assistants. CoinDesk: That's a remarkably different vision from most crypto projects. How does it reshape our financial systems? Eric Winer: If it's my AI agent talking to, say, Amazon's AI agent, and they're going to buy something and negotiate, they're more likely to rationally choose a crypto-based payment method and probably an AI-based dispute resolution method and AI-based credit. We reshape the financial system not by building a better one and trying to convince people to use it, but by building a better one and trying to convince AIs to use it that's easier for AIs and for the people operating them. I think that's the crypto adoption play now: we build a world of AIs talking to AIs on your behalf, and then we convince the AIs that blockchain and decentralization is a better world for them and for us than the one we've got. CoinDesk: So in your view, AI could actually be the catalyst that drives blockchain adoption, rather than the other way around? Eric Winer: I think in the future, and probably not too far in the future, you'll see that vision that everybody seems to want – the super app, the one place you go where everything you do online really becomes an AI assistant. It's giving you a content feed, it's taking action on your behalf, it's spending money on your behalf. And it's not just doing it alone. It's not just hitting APIs and browsing websites – it's talking to other AI agents. It's also handling your interpersonal, person-to-corporate, or person-to-governmental communications. That needs to be a decentralized ecosystem much like the internet is to some extent a decentralized system, but maybe we can do one better on top of blockchain-based registries.

        "content": "Crypto trading infrastructure startup, Theo, has raised a $20 million round co-led by Hack VC and Anthos Capital. Other participants included crypto-native firms and individual investors affiliated with traditional trading companies such as Citadel, Jane Street, and JPMorgan. Theo is developing a system that allows retail users to deposit digital assets into strategy-specific vaults, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. These vaults are designed to provide access to advanced trading strategies—including arbitrage, hedging, and cross-chain funding rate optimization—that are typically used by institutional players. The platform operates on a custom validator network that facilitates trade execution across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. It also enforces margin requirements and system-wide overcollateralization. The startup was founded by ex-Optiver and IMC quant traders Abhi Pingle, Arijit Pingle, and TK Kwon. “Today’s crypto markets are fragmented and inefficient, preventing institutions and everyday users alike from accessing the full promise of global, permissionless finance,” Abhi Pingle said. The press release notes that trading firms can use Theo’s infrastructure to improve capital efficiency by interacting with user-deposited funds, potentially increasing returns while managing execution and risk. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance. Before joining CoinDesk he worked at major financial and crypto publications. He owns bitcoin, ether, solana, and PAXG above CoinDesk's $1,000 disclosure threshold. About Contact",

        "content": "Polygon has launched the Agglayer Breakout Program to support projects building on the Agglayer and Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems in a boost for POL token stakers. The program combines incubation and community-focused funding to help founders develop and launch projects, with successful “graduates” airdropping 5%-15% of their native token supply to POL stakers and integrating with the Agglayer network. It provides hands-on support from Polygon Labs, funding, and access to ecosystem resources to help projects grow quickly and connect to Agglayer’s unified user base and liquidity. \"With the Agglayer Breakout Program, we’re setting the stage for massive ecosystem expansion—and that includes opportunities for POL, with the potential for huge airdrops and rewards flowing back to the community as these projects start growing with massive liquidity addition to Agglayer,\" said Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwa Agglayer, short for aggregation layer, can be thought of as a web of networks that seem like a single chain to a user. It relies on zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a type of cryptography that allows one party to prove a piece of information to another without sharing details. For example, one can prove to a blockchain that they have enough funds to pay another person without showing their wallet balance. The network verifies the payment, but financial details remain private. This is unlike regular blockchains or banking networks that reveal details. That makes it possible to build sophisticated financial and gaming applications, among others, that allow the building of a trustless ecosystem (as public details may attract threat actors). Among the first cohort of the breakout program is Privado ID, a ZK-based identity framework, which has fully graduated and plans to airdrop 5% of its token supply to POL stakers. Miden, a ZK-centric chain led by a former Facebook blockchain alum, is nearing graduation and will airdrop 10% of its tokens. A DeFi chain, still in stealth, is set to airdrop 15%. These Airdrops provide POL stakers with new tokens, increasing the utility of POL as more chains launch. Snapshots to determine airdrop eligibility will begin next week, and stakers can participate by staking POL as of Wednesday.

        "content": "Restaking protocol Ether.fi said it plans to add banking services that will see it become a decentralized finance (DeFi) neobank. The ether.fi app will give users the experience of a traditional fintech app, allowing them to spend, save and earn money through linked crypto features including restaking. The app will allow bill payments and payroll services using fiat money. \"With ether.fi we're bridging the gap between decentralized finance and everyday financial needs,\" CEO Mike Silagadze said in a statement. \"Our goal is to provide users with a robust, user-friendly platform that offers the benefits of DeFi without the complexities, making financial freedom accessible to everyone.\" One of the features under the hood will be ether.fi's cornerstone restaking product, which gives investors the opportunity to secure an additional yield by staking ether (ETH) and receiving liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that can be staked across the DeFi ecosystem. Last month CoinDesk reported on how Ether.fi was one of few restaking protocols that managed to retain total value locked (TVL) despite the sector suffering a drawdown in hype of the past year. It currently has 2.7 million ETH ($4.4 billion) in TVL, a near record high in ETH terms, according to DefiLlama. In September Ether.fi announced the release of its own Visa \"Cash\" card, which would allow cardholders to spend fiat currencies while using crypto as collateral.  This product, as well as the staking service, is now available in the U.S. despite both being previously ring-fenced due to regulatory requirements. It will initially be available in select states following a number of partnerships with local entities to ensure regulatory compliance.  Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. About Contact",

        "content": "Digital bank Revolut's profits surpassed 1 billion pounds ($1.33 billion) in 2024, thanks in part to a big jump in revenue from cryptocurrency trading. The London-based fintech group's wealth revenue increased 298% from 127.1 million pounds to just over 500 million pounds in the full year 2024. Revolut's wealth business includes cryptocurrency, commodities, trading, and savings products. Revolut also surpassed 50 million customers for the first time in 2024, with many of them possibly keen to dip their toe into cryptocurrency trading as the market boomed. Bitcoin (BTC) increased in price by over 120% during the calendar year, which was bookended by the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January and the election victory of the pro-crypto President Trump in November.  The fintech firm wasn't the sole benefactor of the crypto trading surge. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and popular trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) also said they saw a boost from crypto trading activities last year. Both firms are set to report their earnings in the next few weeks.  Across the business at large, Revolut's revenue also increased 72% from 1.8 billion pounds to over 3 billion. Profits before tax surpassed 1 billion pounds, following a nearly 150% increase compared to 2023.  Cryptocurrency has a track record of bolstering Revolut's earnings. The fintech's first annual profit came in 2021, another time customers were looking to cash in on a crypto bull market.

        "content": "Shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) surged 55% on Tuesday and are up an additional 15% in pre-market trading, trading below $19.  The skyward movement was driven by investor optimism around its proposed merger with Twenty One Capital a bitcoin (BTC) native investment vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank. Led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Brandon Lutnick, Twenty One Capital is being positioned as a public proxy for bitcoin, potentially holding over 42,000 BTC at launch and introducing metrics like Bitcoin Per Share (BPS) and Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR) to measure shareholder value in BTC terms. According to the latest pro forma ownership tables, Tether will control 42.8% of equity and 51.7% of voting power, while Bitfinex and SoftBank hold 16.0% and 24.0% of the company respectively, post-convert. Public SPAC shareholders will retain just 2.7% ownership, underscoring the extreme dilution but significant upside if BTC rises. With BTC trading near $94,000, and the entity holding nearly $4B in BTC exposure, investors are re-rating CEP as a high-leverage bet on institutional bitcoin adoption. The stock is set to re-list under ticker “XXI” once the merger is finalized.

        "content": "Zora's much-hyped ZORA token launch was meant to be a celebration — a \"fun\" moment for its community, and a supposed triumph for the tokenization of content creators everywhere, with strong demand expected for the Coinbase Ventures-backed project. Instead, it has turned into a familiar post-airdrop slog so far: A quick pop in price, followed by a slow bleed. The token, issued late Wednesday, is down more than 50% from a price spike following launch, continuing a grim pattern that has become all too common for tokens pushed by venture-backed projects. “Sold my $ZORA, thanks for playin,” wrote one trader, Faycytw, on X, summarizing the sentiment. They humorously posted images of deleting the Zora network and blocking its X profile - a jibe at users exiting most platforms after receiving token rewards. Sold my $ZORA, thanks for playin✅Now, here are 2 things to do pic.twitter.com/s98389toSx Zora’s pitch is that it’s a factory for tokenizing anything — tweets, memes, videos. Its sudden virality this week led to expectations of a game-changing token. Instead, ZORA came with no utility, no governance, and no roadmap beyond the phrase “a token for fun.” What it did have was on-chain liquidity (over $1.7 million) and listings on prominent exchanges, such as Binance Alpha, on the first day. Allocations were calculated based on a user’s activity on Zora, including but not limited to coining, minting, trading and referring. Last week, market watchers also perceived the rampant promotions and backing by senior Base network team members as contentious. Zora’s early price action makes it join the graveyard of tokens swiftly abandoned by fresh recipients, who felt they were being used as exit liquidity for better-connected insiders. “Traders have grown weary of holding altcoins as numerous high-profile and VC-backed projects try to attract new buyers by launching on exchanges with low liquidity,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message.  \"Market makers would pump prices after the listing, but the token price would later decline as vesting schedules created more selling pressure.” “n most cases, token use cases could not offset the selling pressure, as utilities were often limited to governance, discounts, subscriptions, or other low-buying-pressure services,” Ruck added. The pattern is what industry people call the “low float, high FDV” trap — where tokens are launched with sky-high fully diluted valuations but only a sliver of supply available for trading. Another qualm is transparency, where a sizable amount may be held by team members directly or indirectly. Another perfect example of why teams shouldn’t chase sky-high valuations pre-TGE:@zora raised at a 600M FDV.Being under pressure (understandably), $ZORA listed at 350M - and instantly dumped -50% to 175M.When will teams finally get it?List low.Create max upside.Let the… pic.twitter.com/xjkQrzXfpX “The $ZORA launch highlights a recurring issue in Web3: overpromising and underdelivering,” said Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto. “When a project markets itself as community-first but fails to communicate transparently — especially around something as sensitive as a token drop — it quickly erodes trust.” “Labeling the token ‘for fun’ with no utility only deepened the confusion and frustration,” Jung added. Online, some watchers indicate the sell-off is reflective of cautious market sentiment. ‘The fact that $zora is at $50m mcap on day 1 means we've made good progress,” well-followed trader CryptoKoryo said on X. “One year ago a VC funded project like that could have launched at maybe $500m, shilled by a big actor like Coinbase, when sentiment was bullish and prices going up.” The fact that $zora is at $50m mcap on day 1 means we've made good progress.one year ago a VC funded project like that could have launched at maybe $500m, shilled by a big actor like Coinbase, when sentiment was bullish and prices going up. pic.twitter.com/N6Mw8jJSmO Despite the backlash, Zora still holds significant clout in the creator crypto space. Its NFT minting protocol has seen solid adoption in the past week, metrics show, and both digital artists and brands have favored its platform. That’s not to say ZORA prices may not pick up in the coming days or weeks, especially as it trades around the 2-cent level as of Thursday morning at a relatively small $73 million market capitalization. Risk-takers could see short-term upside as the initial sell-off settles, and current valuations of a token linked to Coinbase and Base seem attractive. However, the no-utility nature of ZORA is reminiscent of lessons from the past: Tokens without substance rarely hold their shine for long.

        "content": "Americans reported a record $9.3 billion in losses to cryptocurrency-related crimes in 2024, according to a report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The losses represent a 66% jump from 2023 and highlight the growing use of digital assets in online fraud schemes. The annual IC3 report says nearly 150,000 complaints linked to crypto, with investment fraud leading the way. In these schemes, scammers often pretend to offer high returns on fake cryptocurrency platforms, coaxing victims to transfer funds that are then siphoned away. The FBI also spotlighted “pig butchering” scams, where fraudsters build online relationships before pushing fake crypto investments. Crypto investment schemes led to $5.8 billion in losses, while the second-largest category by losses at $1.1 billion were data breaches. Elderly Americans bore the brunt of the damage. Individuals over 60 reported $2.8 billion in losses through crypto-related crimes—more than any other age group— up from $1.65 billion in 2023 and $1.08 billion in 2022. The second-most affected age group, those aged 40-49, suffered $1.4 billion in losses, while those under the age of 40 suffered combined losses of around $1.37 billion. Over 8,000 of the complaints stemmed from people over 60 and related to fake investment opportunities, while others fell victim to tech support fraud and impersonation schemes, often involving cryptocurrency ATMs. Operation Level Up, a government initiative launched in January 2024, identified thousands of victims of crypto investment fraud and prevented an estimated $285 million in further losses, per the report. It referred 42 victims for suicide intervention. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

        "content": "Hit TV series Peaky Blinders, which reached an estimated audience of 80 million through platforms like Netflix, is set to be adapted into a blockchain-based video game and wider Web3 ecosystem, the companies behind the effort announced on Thursday. It is being developed by Anonymous Labs, a Web3 venture builder that previously launched the Simon’s Cat cartoon IP token. The company is partnering with Banijay Rights, the global distributor of Peaky Blinders, to expand the show’s presence into blockchain gaming and fan engagement tools. The smoky streets of 1920s England are reimagined as a decentralized playground where fans can dive into high-stakes missions, craft their own Shelby-style legacy (the family the series is based around), and engage with the Peaky Blinders universe. The game is being designed as an AAA title (a gaming buzzword where such products have extensive development budgets, large teams, and emphasis on high technical quality). It will feature digital collectibles and community engagement mechanisms that use blockchains. The goal is to onboard traditional Peaky Blinders fans into crypto through interactive storytelling and gameplay. \"Peaky Blinders is arguably the biggest IP to date to embark on building a blockchain-based project, and I see this as a defining moment for the entire Web3 industry,” Wojciech Gruszka, head of Development at Peaky Blinders Web3 Game, said in a statement. “This project is not just about creating an incredible user experience—it’s a gateway to bringing blockchain new revenue streams and building brand loyalty in the Web3 space,” Gruszka added. Specific details around token mechanics, launch timelines, or the game's economic structure have not been disclosed as of Thursday.

        "content": "Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is offering digital asset managers special accounts that allow pooling of their investors’ assets to make crypto fund management operations feel more like a traditional finance experience. The omnibus “Fund Accounts” introduce a universal net asset value (NAV) per unit concept used by buyside firms to provide a clear and trackable profit-and-loss for each fund, addressing the lack of a common market standard in crypto asset management, Binance said on Wednesday. Unlike the rarified world of high finance, crypto trading is still developing from a relatively unsophisticated retail market into a more institutional-friendly environment, a process that requires a transformation of infrastructure. “Asset management is a very mature and well established industry in TradFi,” said Binance head of institutional and VIP Catherine Chen in an interview. “In crypto, we think there's a lot of demand for this particular expertise and infrastructure because, for the time being, the entry barriers and the learning curve remains relatively steep.” There are pain points for both investors and managers, Chen said. For investors, trust is important, so using an established brand with clear proof of reserves and transparent NAV are key factors, she said. Eligible asset managers, who need to be licensed in their respective jurisdictions, no longer face such a heavy burden of admin and other operational tasks, and can create multiple fund accounts and deploy different trading strategies tailored to each fund. The expected size of asset managers likely to be attracted to Binance Fund Accounts could range from about $1 million assets under management (AUM) at the lower end, to around $20 million, Chen estimated. “It's gonna be a mixture. But obviously this type of infrastructure is really catering to those newer or smaller asset managers to bootstrap and properly scale the business,” she said.
