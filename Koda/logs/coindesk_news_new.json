        "content": "Banks need to be part of crypto for stablecoins to succeed—that was the message from Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s senior vice president of digital currencies, during a panel discussion at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. \"It might sound counterintuitive, but you do want the banks in this space,\" Fernandez da Ponte said, adding that their infrastructure—from custody to providing fiat rails—will be essential if stablecoins are to scale beyond crypto-native circles. \"You want that connectivity and that fabric to work.\" His remarks came amid efforts to bring regulatory clarity for digital assets in the U.S., with lawmakers inching closer to pass stablecoin legislation that could redefine the market and allow banks to enter the space.

[The stablecoin legislation] is going to answer a lot of those questions.\" Both executives said they expect a wave of new issuers to enter the market once regulation is in place, followed by a period of consolidation. “It’s not going to be 300 stablecoins, and it’s not going to be just two,” Fernandez da Ponte said. Currently, Tether's USDT USDT$1.00 and Circle's USDC USDC$0.99995 dominate the market, representing nearly 90% of the $230 billion asset class. PayPal’s PYUSD PYUSD$0.99946, launched in 2023, lags far behind with $900 million supply. Fernandez da Ponte pushed back on market cap as the primary metric for success. \"We look at velocity, active wallets, number of transactions,” he said. “Those are what drive real usage.\" In countries with high inflation and volatile currencies, consumers are seeking out dollar-backed stablecoins as stores of value and tools for cross-border payments. Soohoo said MoneyGram, which operates in over 200 countries with nearly half a million cash-access locations, is helping facilitate that access. \"We see ourselves between physical finance and digital finance,\" Soohoo said. \"A lot of consumers in local economies want to hold value in dollars but still need to access it as cash to spend in places that don’t take digital currency.\" Stablecoin adoption in developed countries, meanwhile, has been slower. With clear regulation in place, stablecoins can streamline corporate treasury operations and cross-border disbursement, Fernandez da Ponte noted. \"We used to have this mad rush on Friday to make sure money was in the right places before the weekend,\" he said. \"Now we’re sending money to the Philippines and Africa in ten minutes with stablecoins.\" Both executives noted that real-world use cases, not hype, will determine if stablecoins could reach the trillion-dollar scale in the next years that's been projected. \"Consumers don’t care about stablecoins. They care about solving problems.\" Fernandez da Ponte said. \"We’re five years into a ten-year journey, and regulation will define the next half.\" Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

        "content": "The global head of policy at TRM Labs, a blockchain analytics firm that helps law enforcement investigate crypto fraud, shared that he believes Coinbase’s handling of the latest hack is a “really great example to other businesses in terms of how to handle” dealing with hacks of exchanges. At a panel at Consensus 2025, Ari Redbord discussed how easy it is for hacks to happen on crypto exchanges, as the industry is “the perfect storm of weak cyber controls and ultimately it's a good target.” Coinbase shared earlier on Thursday that some of its staff had been bribed to steal their customers' data, and its founder Brian Armstrong had received a ransome note for $20 million dollars in bitcoin. The team shared in a blog post that because of the breach, it could pay up to $400 million in remediation costs to affected customers, and that they were setting up a $20 million bounty on any information related to the attackers instead. The news comes as the industry has experienced other major hacks, like Bybit which was hacked earlier this year for $1.5 billion, and defunct crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 for $400 million. Though these episodes seem to happen frequently, Redbord believes more regulatory involvement can alleviate some of these issues. “There's a lot we can do with governments in order to go after these bad actors that have nothing to do with crypto or blockchain intelligence,” he said. “We have cyber facilities.” Read more: Coinbase Could Pay Customers Up to $400M for Data Breach Margaux Nijkerk reports on the Ethereum protocol and L2s.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 18:52:54 +0000",
        "content": "The latest draft of the U.S. Senate's stablecoin legislation includes enough changes that Democratic senators may now have an easier time getting back on board, though consumer advocates say it still falls short. The bill to set oversight and standards for stablecoin issuers sailed through the Senate Banking Committee with wide bipartisan support in March, but it hit a wall on the Senate floor last week as many Democrats raised objections. Chief among them were the conflicts that may be presented by President Donald Trump's own crypto interests and the possibility that big technology firms like Meta and social-media site X may be able to issue such tokens.  \"As the result of hard-fought negotiations, Democrats won major victories on a range of critical issues,\" proponents noted in a summary circulated with the draft bill. The question remaining is: Will it be enough to get back to a so-called cloture vote that will advance the bill to a floor debate that would mark its final major stage before the Senate takes a vote. The next procedural move on the Senate floor could come by next week, according to people familiar with the talks. The latest changes to the bill represent a mixed bag. The loudest requests from critics, that the president be explicitly stopped from personally benefiting from the crypto industry that his administration will regulate, were not directly addressed in this version of the bill. But on the concerns over tech giants sprouting with a field of new dollar-based tokens, the bill dealt with it in part: \"A public company that is not predominantly engaged in one or more financial activities, and its wholly or majority owned subsidiaries or affiliates, may not issue a payment stablecoin unless the public company obtains a unanimous vote of the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee,\" according to the latest draft. The committee would be a multi-agency group created under the legislation to look at such requests. There are major loopholes in that, according to Mark Hays, who focuses on crypto and financial-technology issues for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. For starters, he said, it affects only public companies and not private ones, such as X and TiKTok. \"There's already a way that large tech firms that aren't public could become issuers without adhering to these new standards,\" he said. Also, he added, \"it's quite possible under this bill that a public company could secure an interest in a non-public company, and that's another way around it.\" He argued that this overall draft gave toothless answers to the concern of consumer advocates. \"Pushing this through on an arbitrary deadline because the crypto industry is breathing down your neck is not a good way to make policy,\" Hays said. \"And it's especially bad when that policy could further enable and enrich the president.\" Bo Hines, one of Trump's chief advisers on crypto, appeared at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Wednesday to insist that there's no conflict in the president's business interests or his family's involvement in the industry, including its stake in World Liberty Financial. He said that Trump \"can't be bought.\" The White House's Hines, who acts as a liaison to Capitol Hill during the legislative negotiations, expressed continued confidence about the effort staying on track in the Senate. \"Negotiations are ongoing,\" Hines said at Consensus. \"But I remain steadfast in my optimism that we're going to achieve — the president's desire is to do it — both stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.\" Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

        "content": "The SEC has been investigating crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) over whether it misstated its user numbers in past securities filings and marketing materials.  The probe began under the former presidential administration while the SEC was still under the control of then-Chair Gary Gensler, according to the NYT, which first reported the story, but has persisted under the SEC’s current, crypto-friendly leadership. The metric at the heart of the investigation is Coinbase’s claim to have over 100 million “verified users.” It stopped using the metric in both disclosure and marketing materials in 2021, the year it went public on the Nasdaq. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement that the SEC’s investigation is a “hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public.” “We explained that the verified users metric includes anyone who verified their email address or phone number with us, so it may overstate the number of unique customers,\" said Grewal \"We also disclosed – and continue to disclose – the more relevant metric of ‘monthly transacting users’ – the number of people who use our platform in a given month.\" “While we strongly believe this investigation should not continue, we remain committed to working with the SEC to bring this matter to a close,” Grewal added. The SEC did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time. Already under pressure due to today's disclosure of a data breach, COIN shares dipped a bit further on this SEC news, now down 6.6% on the session.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 17:44:16 +0000",
        "content": "TORONTO —Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, said he believes bitcoin is digital gold and called the largest digital currency a store of value, during a packed panel at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  \"I really believe in digital gold, which is bitcoin, right? I believe in the store of value,\" Trump said. However, Eric Trump — who has a background in real estate — told the crowd at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto that he didn't get into bitcoin or crypto until politics intertwined the Trump family and the crypto community. \"It wasn't until the very same group that was attacking my family for no reason whatsoever other than political beliefs, started attacking [the] crypto community that it really drove two people who might not have always been like-minded together and that partnership has been absolutely amazing,\" he said Thursday. Aside from politics, he also realized real estate is not as liquid as bitcoin, which has better liquidity and was easier to transact, solidifying his belief in the digital currency. \"I also realized, kind of, through some of that political weaponization, you know, some of the limitations of real estate. Real estate has created tremendous wealth for our family. At the same time, real estate can't be transferred. It's very hard to sell,\" he said. \"I sold a hotel two years ago. It took me a year and a half to literally transact that hotel because you have title reports and you have managers that have to go in, and you have best proliferations. You do all sorts of things,\" Trump said. \"... You constantly have to manage it. You constantly have to watch operations, right? And then all of a sudden, you've got this kind of digital asset which you don't need to watch, you don't need to manage. You know, it's easy to transact on.\" Trump is the co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining firm founded in partnership with Hut 8 and slated to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). The Gryphon partnership came about from a desire to take the American Bitcoin partnership public as quickly as possible, said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot on stage alongside Trump to a standing-room only crowd. An existing mining business was a key part of that plan as well as getting 'American' and 'bitcoin' as part of the company name.  \"American Bitcoin, to me, is everything, you know. And I we came up with the name, I said one thing. I said, Listen, it has to have the word American, and it has to have the word Bitcoin in it,\" Trump said.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant fluctuations as global economic factors and regulatory developments create both challenges and opportunities. Litecoin's recent price action reflects this broader market sentiment, with the cryptocurrency encountering strong resistance at $101.65 after reaching a peak of $101.90. Despite the subsequent correction to the $95-$96 range, LTC has shown resilience with support emerging around $95.82.  Market analysts point to the recent US-China tariff agreement as a key driver behind Litecoin's price movements, with the cryptocurrency gaining bullish momentum following the deal announcement. Additionally, Federal Reserve policy decisions have contributed to positive sentiment in risk assets, helping LTC maintain its position above critical support levels despite the correction.  In the regulatory landscape, the SEC has delayed decisions on spot ETF applications for several cryptocurrencies including Litecoin, creating uncertainty but also anticipation. Despite these delays, betting markets show ~80% probability for approval before year-end, suggesting continued optimism among investors. This regulatory environment, combined with increasing institutional adoption and cross-border transaction utility, positions Litecoin as a significant player in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio shared Thursday that he thinks the blockchain wasn’t necessarily meant to be a “competitor to Bitcoin,” but rather “it was meant to be an alternative.” Speaking to a crowd at Consensus 2025, Di Iorio shared with the audience about his time during Ethereum’s early days, noting back then that he understood that the project could become a really big movement. “We could sense and feel that it was picking up,” Di Iorio said. Di Iorio was one of the eight co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, but originally got into cryptocurrency through his advocacy with Bitcoin. He started Bitcoin meetups in Toronto in 2012, and through that met Vitalik Buterin, who came up with the Ethereum whitepaper and shared it with his fellow co-founders. While Di Iorio is still a big Bitcoin proponent, he has said that “I do think eventually Ethereum has a possibility of overtaking it in terms of market capitalization.” “With the amount of use cases, and the value that Ethereum is allowing to be created, I think it has that opportunity, in order to possibly overtake it,” Di Iorio added. After stepping away from the Ethereum Foundation, Anthony Di Iorio founded Decentral in 2014, which is best known for creating the Jaxx Liberty crypto wallet. In 2022, he launched Andiami, a project blending hardware, tokenomics, and game theory to tackle centralization vectors within decentralized networks.

        "content": "Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Leary Ventures, said the crypto industry isn’t regulated enough — which is holding digital assets back from true institutional adoption. Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Thursday, O’Leary said crypto assets under management (AUM) have hit a wall, which he attributed to a lack of regulatory clarity that has prevented the majority of sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and institutional investors from investing meaningfully. “I never thought I’d say this, but I want more regulation and I want it now,” O’Leary said. “The good news is there’s a new sheriff in town: Paul Atkins at the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission].” O’Leary said Atkins, who was sworn in as chairman of the SEC last month, has already telegraphed that he’s friendly to the crypto industry and will “regulate accordingly.” Atkins replaces Gary Gensler, whose penchant for so-called “regulation by enforcement” drew the ire of many in the crypto industry. O’Leary said Thursday that he respected Gensler’s consistency as a regulator. “He said he was gonna sue you, and he sued you,” O’Leary said. “He was consistent and you have to respect that.” In a press conference ahead of his keynote speech, O’Leary said he'd received a Wells notice from the SEC over a decade ago after speaking about debt tokenization in a televised interview. He was cleared, he said, but the experience temporarily scared him off engaging with crypto in the U.S. “My first experience with crypto was over a decade ago, when I was on business cable, talking about debt tokenization,” O’Leary said. “I get a knock on my door and it’s an enforcement agent from the SEC serving me a Wells notice. I shit my pants … The regulator was sending a message. I got the message” Since Gensler departed the agency in January, the SEC has done an about-face on its approach to crypto regulation, creating a Crypto Task Force spearheaded by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce and dropping a host of open investigations and lawsuits against crypto companies that were started under Gensler. A friendlier SEC isn’t the only thing O’Leary is hopeful for when it comes to crypto regulation — he expects to see the passage of the GENIUS Act within “months.” “The minute that happens, it will signal the move to the next act, the market infrastructure act,” O’Leary said. “And when that is determined and regulated, Katy, bar the doors — a trillion dollars will come in and index [bitcoin].” On the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime. Cheyenne is originally from Houston, Texas. She studied political science at Tulane University in Louisiana. In December 2021, she graduated from CUNY's Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, where she focused on business and economics reporting. She has no significant crypto holdings.

        "content": "The daughter and grandson of a French crypto exchange CEO were targeted in a failed kidnap attempt, adding to the growing number of crypto-related kidnapping cases in the country, France 24 reported on Tuesday. A video widely shared on social media showed the attempt, in which three masked men wrestled the woman and another person to the ground in Paris. A shop owner intervened, waving a fire extinguisher, and the attackers gave up, driving off in two waiting vans. France 24 identified the crypto exchange as Paymium. The attack follows earlier — successful — kidnappings in the country. In January, David Ballard, a co-founder of crypto-wallet developer Ledger, was ransomed after being kidnapped with his wife from their home. In May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was kidnapped and rescued days later. Four suspects were arrested at the time, the BBC reported. Both of the men had a finger chopped off. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Wednesday he plans to meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to discuss how to protect them following the surge of kidnappers targeting wealthy people with crypto ties in France. The Paris prosecutors office opened an investigation into the attack, Reuters reported. \"These units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,\" Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin said at Consensus on Wednesday in response to a question on the worldwide kidnapping for ransom trend. \"I think that the message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable.\" Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

After establishing resistance at $6.780, UNI cascaded downward with multiple high-volume selling periods, breaking below critical support levels, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. This volatility comes as blockchain data reveals large institutional holders transferred substantial UNI positions to centralized exchanges, with two addresses moving 11.65 million tokens ($82.38M) to Coinbase Prime.Technical Analysis Highlights Disclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

        "content": "After a suddenly rocky road for the U.S. legislative effort to regulate stablecoin issuers, the Senate is poised to move forward again with newly polished language in the bill that may see some procedural movement as soon as Thursday. The Senate's stablecoin push veered off course a week ago when Democrats objected, primarily to President Donald Trump's personal crypto business interests, but the lawmakers continued negotiations and are said to be close to an agreement on updated text to the \"Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins\" (GENIUS) Act, according to people familiar with the talks. The bill would establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of another asset, such as Tether's USDT$1.00 and Circle's USDC$0.99995, and there's a similar one grinding its way through the House of Representatives. A previous version of the bill advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support earlier this year, giving the crypto sector confidence that it would probably meet with little resistance on the Senate floor. However, the text was updated and the Senate failed to advance the bill into its final stage, a process known as cloture in which 60 senators need to agree to move legislation to an open floor debate. Every Democrat and two Republicans voted against it (a third Republican, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, originally supported the cloture motion but flipped his vote at the last minute in a procedural move to keep the legislation alive). That left the stablecoin bill in legislative limbo, but people familiar with the negotiation told CoinDesk that it may soon be back on track. The next vote would likely be a procedural action to buy lawmakers more time to negotiate specifics of the bill than a cloture motion, two of the people said. One of the central points of contention for Democrats was President Trump's increasing forays into crypto, particularly after Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX announced it would close its purchase of a stake in global exchange Binance using USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, which in turn is linked to Trump and his children. However, the bill's text, which hasn't yet been released publicly, is unlikely to include any provisions addressing this potential conflict of interest. Senator Gillibrand, the New York Democrat who has been working on crypto legislation for years, suggested at a Stand With Crypto event on Wednesday that the latest version still doesn't focus directly on Trump. \"This bill does have some ethics requirements that I think are really strong and very good, but it's not an ethics bill per se, and if we were dealing with all President Trump's ethics problems, it would be a very long and detailed bill,\" she said.  She said she's \"very optimistic we will have a vote soon enough.\" At the same event, Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Republican chair of a digital assets subcommittee in the Senate and a frequent partner to Gillibrand on crypto regulation, argued against lawmakers being distracted by the \"shiny object that's out in the corner.\" \"I don't want the fact that President Trump's name comes up in relation to this to distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry that is being used to provide a new market for US Treasuries that helps the dollar stay the world reserve currency,\" Lummis said. Bo Hines, Trump's executive director for the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto on Wednesday that \"negotiations are ongoing\" when asked about a possible vote on Thursday. He indicated that he thinks the legislation will keep moving. \"We shall see,\" he said.

        "content": "Berachain is focused on building “decorrelated populations” of users to guard against market reflexivity, said Smokey the Bera, theblockchain’s pseudonymous founder, onstage at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2025 event in Toronto. Reflexivity is a big concern in decentralised finance and crypto. It refers to the self-reinforcing effect of market sentiment. Rising prices often attract buyers and create a positive feedback loop. However, the same process can operate in reverse leading to a catastrophic collapse in prices. Berachain’s plan for the second and third quarters is to support profitable businesses that exist in web2 and are uncorrelated to the existing DeFi and crypto markets. Doing so will help Berachain guard against reflexivity, helping it weather market volatility and retain deep liquidity, Smokey said. Smokey was joined by Jason Atkins from market making firm Auros, when they discussed all things to do with liquidity — essentially how easily and quickly a crypto asset can be bought or sold without a significant impact on its price. Tim reports on all things DeFi. He came to CoinDesk from DL News where he published over 400 articles covering everything from institutional adoption to DAO governance. He reported extensively on North Korea’s $1.4 billion theft from crypto exchange Bybit and documented its impact across the crypto industry. He also conducted multiple investigations into alleged crypto scams, and his reporting on Waves was cited in a lawsuit filed by the FTX Recovery Trust against the blockchain’s founder Sasha Ivanov. His previous reporting on the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was also cited in documents submitted to the High Court of Singapore.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:00:00 +0000",
        "content": "0x, a decentralized exchange infrastructure firm, announced the acquisition of rival Flood, a move the firm says will help it compete in the hyper competitive aggregation market. Decentralized exchanges — or DEXs — are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. They let blockchain users swap between assets without the need for an intermediary or middleman such as a centralized exchange. Aggregators like 0x’s act as a one-stop-shop for traders, searching all the DEXs out there to find the one that offers the most cost-efficient trades, for a small fee. Competition is fierce and often exists on razor-thin margins. It was Flood’s proprietary aggregation software that motivated the acquisition, Amir Bandeali, CEO of 0x, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. 0x uses its own trade simulation technology to check how well its aggregation software works compared with its competitors, Bandeali said. “We were able to take a look at Flood as well and run similar types of tests and we were very impressed with the data that we saw.” “Everything got made from scratch,” Francesco Baccetti, co-founder and CEO of Flood, told CoinDesk. “We rewrote the whole stack to get this level of performance that we now have.” The acquisition is 0x’s first since the firm’s founding in 2017. A spokesperson for 0x declined to share how much it paid for Flood, citing contractual obligations. Flood raised $5.2 million from investors in a February 2024 seed funding round. DEX aggregators are a big business. Over the past week, the top 12 aggregators facilitated almost $10 billion worth of swap volume, around 10% of all on-chain trading, according to data compiled by Fredrik Haga, co-founder of Dune Analytics. Aggregators with tradable tokens are valued at a combined $2.3 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 0x is one of the oldest DEX aggregators. But it’s not the largest. On Ethereum and other compatible blockchains, 1inch and CoW Swap consistently handle the most trading volume among aggregators, while on Solana, Jupiter dominates. Bandeali said he’s hopeful that by combining the two companies' technologies, 0x will be able to win market share from larger aggregators on both Ethereum and Solana. Another motivation for the acquisition was Flood’s team of developers. “This is a pretty niche domain,” Bandeali said, explaining that it's very difficult for his firm to find talented developers who specialize in aggregation and trade routing. Having the right developers therefore is crucial to an aggregator’s continued success. “It sounds simple but it’s really complicated,” he said. “It gets more complicated as new chains and new tokens launch.” The reward for proving the best swaps is great. CoW Swap is set to bring in almost $11 million in revenue this year, according to DefiLlama data. (It’s unclear how much revenue 1inch makes, while Jupiter’s projected $162 million in revenue comes from more than just its aggregation services). 0x has also expanded into other areas, such as providing APIs that integrate its aggregator into other products, and trading analytics. But improving its core aggregation product, which powers swaps in apps like Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood, Phantom and Farcaster, is still the main focus. And with DeFi getting more complex by the day, the demand for aggregators is likely to keep increasing. “We’re just trying to abstract away the complexity faster than it’s created for our customers,” Bandeali said.

Learn more. – Sarah Morton When major financial institutions — from Citi and Standard Chartered to Brevan Howard, McKinsey and BCG — rally around a once-niche innovation, it’s a good idea to take note, especially when the innovation is stablecoins, a tokenized representation of money on-chain. What email was to the internet, stablecoin is to blockchain — instant and cost-effective value transfer at a global scale running 24/7. Stablecoin is blockchain’s first killer use case. First introduced by Tether in 2015 and hailed as the first stablecoin, USDT offered early crypto users a way to hold and transfer a stable, dollar-denominated value on-chain. Until then, their only alternative was bitcoin. Tether’s dollar-backed stablecoin made its debut on Bitfinex before rapidly spreading to major exchanges like Binance and OKX. It quickly became the default trading pair across the digital asset ecosystem. As adoption grew, so did its utility. No longer just a trading tool, stablecoin emerged as the primary cash-equivalent for trading, cash management, and payments. Below is the trajectory of stablecoin’s market size since inception, a reflection of its evolution from a crypto niche to a core pillar of digital finance. The reason stablecoins have been a hot topic in finance is their rapid adoption and growth. According to Visa, stablecoin on-chain transaction volume exceeded $5.5 trillion in 2024. By comparison, Visa’s volume was $13.2 trillion while Mastercard transacted $9.7 trillion during the same period. Why such proliferation? Because stable dollar-denominated cash is the lifeblood for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here are 3 major use cases for stablecoin. 1. Digital Assets Trading Given its origins, it's no surprise that trading was stablecoin’s first major use case. What began as a niche tool for value preservation in 2015 is now the beating heart of digital asset trading. Today, stablecoins underpin over $30 trillion in annual trading volume across centralized exchanges, powering the vast majority of spot and derivatives activity. But stablecoin’s impact doesn’t end with centralized exchanges — It is also the liquidity backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Onchain traders need the same reliable cash equivalent for moving in and out of positions. A glance at leading decentralized platforms, such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Hyperliquid, shows that top trading pairs are consistently denominated by stablecoins. Monthly decentralized exchange volumes routinely hit $100-200 billion, according to The Block, further cementing stablecoin’s role as the foundational layer of the modern digital assets market. 2. Real World Assets Real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as bonds and equities. Once a fringe idea, RWAs are now among the fastest-growing asset classes in crypto. Leading this wave is the tokenized U.S. Treasury market, now boasting over $6 billion AUM. Launched in early 2023, these on-chain Treasuries opened the door for crypto-native capital to access the low-risk, short-duration US T-Bills yield. The adoption saw a staggering 6,000% growth according to RWA.xyz: from just $100 million in early 2023 to over $6 billion AUM today. Asset management heavyweights such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity (pending SEC approval) are all creating on-chain treasury products for digital capital markets. Unlike traditional Treasuries, these digital versions offer 24/7 instant mint/redemptions, and seamless composability with other DeFi yield opportunities. Investors can subscribe and redeem around the clock, with stablecoin liquidity delivered in real time. Circle’s facility with BlackRock’s BUIDL and PayPal’s integration with Ondo’s OUSG are just two prominent examples. 3. Payment A major emerging use case for stablecoins is cross-border payment, especially in corridors underserved by traditional financial infrastructure. In much of the world, international payments remain slow, expensive, and error-prone due to dependency on correspondent banking. By contrast, stablecoins offer merchants and consumers an alternative with its instant, low-cost, always-on transfers. According to research from a16z, stablecoin payments are 99.99% cheaper and 99.99% faster than traditional wire transfers and they settle 24/7. The shift is gaining momentum in the West, too. Stripe’s $1 billion acquisition of Bridge and subsequent introduction of Stablecoin Financial Account signal the start of mainstream global adoption. Meanwhile, PayPal’s rollout of yield on PYUSD balances highlights stablecoin’s rise as a legitimate retail payment vertical. What was once a crypto-native solution is fast becoming a global financial utility. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q. In light of the recent news from Europe regarding stablecoins and Tether, can you explain how stablecoin investment is valuable to an individual? A. In the inherently volatile and highly risky world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide individuals with a capital-efficient way to gain exposure to digital assets. Pegged to fiat currencies like the euro or commodities like gold, these digital assets provide stability and a hedge against crypto’s volatility. Crypto individuals can park their funds safely in stablecoins during times of uncertainty without having to exit the market and deal with TradFi. This is why stablecoins dominate crypto. Their combined market cap has surpassed $245bln, a massive 15x growth over the last five years. Q. Given current market trends in Europe, are stablecoins more or less susceptible to market fluctuations? A. While stablecoins are inherently less volatile than typical crypto assets, they remain sensitive to regulatory developments and issuer credibility. When it comes to Europe, specifically, stablecoins have become less susceptible to market fluctuations due to stringent regulatory measures. This includes the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a clear legal framework that requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and comply with strict governance standards. Such rules reduce the risk of de-pegging and enhance overall stability. However, this leads to market consolidation, a lack of competition, and reduced innovation at the same time. Q. Is Europe becoming a new stablecoin hub as it becomes more receptive to crypto? A. Europe has been signalling a friendly approach to crypto through MiCA, the first comprehensive crypto framework globally that introduces licensing requirements for digital asset service providers and AML protocols. The aim is to create a structured and harmonized regulatory environment for the crypto market, protect customers, and ensure financial stability. Through its evolving MiCA regulations, Europe could certainly enhance institutional confidence and attract more stablecoin issuers. However, that would require overcoming licensing (a lengthy and costly process) issues, effective implementation at national levels, and adapting to the fast-progressing crypto space. Europe is currently not a global leader in stablecoin adoption, but with clearer rules coming into place and its openness to compliant entities, it is well-positioned to emerge as a key hub for compliant stablecoin innovation. - Trevor Koverko, co-founder, Sapien Harvey Li writes about the business of tokenization and help teams navigate the roadblocks that stall adoption. As the founder of Tokenization Insight, the premier tokenization intelligence & GTM platform for institutions, he has a simple conviction: tokenization will transform global markets but only with the right products, distribution strategies, and communication frameworks in place. He work with leading tokenization teams to position them top-of-mind with key institutional stakeholders and support emerging startups in crafting and executing go-to-market strategies. Clients he's supported include Ondo Finance ($1B+ AUM), Ownera (interoperability partner to DTCC and JPMorgan) and Provenance Blockchain. About Contact",

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 14:27:20 +0000",
        "content": "TORONTO — Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, made a case for Canada's new government to create a national crypto strategy during his appearance at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  Speaking on a panel titled, \"What the new Canadian Government Needs to do to Lead In Crypto,\" Matheson outlined some key steps he believes will help position Canada as a leader in the blockchain space. Matheson highlighted that Canada has long been a hub for crypto innovation, citing Ethereum's origins and the strong presence of Web3 developers at Canadian universities.  However, he said the country risks falling behind as other nations actively shape crypto policies. \"We need leadership. We need champions in government to embrace this technology and legitimize it in the eyes of the everyday Canadian,\" Matheson said. He emphasized the importance of having a dedicated federal crypto leader, similar to the U.S. crypto czar. One of his primary suggestions was for Carney to establish a government-led crypto task force within the first 100 days of the new administration.  This task force would develop a national crypto strategy, including defining digital assets, regulating stablecoins, and allowing banks to hold crypto securely. Matheson also proposed creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and integrating crypto mining with existing data centers. Matheson noted that stablecoins could play a key role in making digital assets less speculative, suggesting that Canada needs a stable, Canadian-dollar-denominated coin to boost financial efficiency.  \"One in five Canadians remit money abroad. We pay between 6% and 12% to remit money all around the world. And today, with crypto, you can click different buttons on your phone and send your friends and family 6% to 12% more money,\" he said. Metheson also noted that 15% of Canadians are considered underbanked in Canada, which creates \"a significant opportunity for us to drive innovation and change,\" in the country via crypto.  To further advocate for policy change, Matheson pointed to the \"Stand with Crypto\" initiative.  This aims to educate lawmakers about blockchain's benefits and address misconceptions. He noted that the initiative is gaining traction among industry leaders and aims to build support among the members of Parliament. As Canada transitions to a new government led by Mark Carney, Matheson expressed optimism about the new administration's new mandates regarding innovative technology.  \"They [Liberals] are mandated to build Canada to find economic growth and opportunities for us to embrace technology. And we have a government that is highly motivated to think of opportunities to help our country gain more economic advantage. And I think crypto and other technologies will need to be embraced, and to do that, we need to educate them,\" he said.  However, Matheson cautioned that Canada risks being left behind in the global race to integrate crypto into the financial system unless it takes swift action. He compared the current challenges in Canada as \"a square peg, round hole, legal definitional problem,\" due to several different layers of securities regulators. This means that Canadians are forced to look elsewhere for crypto-related services, potentially resulting in a loss of opportunity for the country and opening users to risks. \"We're at risk for not moving fast enough to embrace the types of technology and products and services in Canada, and as a regulated financial institution, it's a priority for us to make sure that we can introduce these products and services in a compliant way, so that Canadians aren't just using a VPN and jumping off and using non compliant platforms around the world.\" Read more: Coinbase’s Lucas Matheson on Why Canada Needs a Blockchain Strategy Aoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's Head of Americas.

        "content": "Movement Labs, the scandal-plagued crypto startup backed by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial, quietly promised large stakes of its token to early insiders—undisclosed deals that now raise fresh questions about who really holds power behind the scenes. Even before its token launch, Movement Labs committed large portions of MOVE’s supply to a handful of early advisers — arrangements that were never disclosed to investors and only surfaced through internal documents reviewed by CoinDesk. Two business memos obtained by CoinDesk — one promising a single adviser nearly $2 million a year — show how Movement, founded in 2023 by two 20-year-old Vanderbilt dropouts, leaned heavily on these advisers to gain a foothold in the crypto industry. Movement Labs said the agreements, dated shortly after the project's founding, were exploratory in nature and non-binding. The existence of the agreements nonetheless casts new light on the chaotic inner workings of Movement, which came under fire after CoinDesk reported last month that insider market-making deals enabled token dumping by insiders. The fallout has sparked waves of finger-pointing inside the company, centering on who steered Movement into a predatory agreement with a Chinese market maker under terms that analysts say incentivized predatory selling. The tension has boiled over into a public rift between co-founders Rushi Manche, who was terminated by Movement Labs this month, and Cooper Scanlon, who stepped back from his CEO role but remains at the company. “When we started Movement, I was the CTO — leading the engineering team. I left most business decisions, including the contracts, to Cooper,” Manche told CoinDesk when reached for comment. “When priorities changed, our roles changed, but Cooper’s decisions in the early days heavily shaped the way the launch went.” CoinDesk spoke to more than a dozen people familiar with Movement over the course of its investigation, including current and former employees who were granted anonymity so they could speak freely. The agreements obtained by CoinDesk concern Sam Thapaliya and Vinit Parekh, both of whom played behind-the-scenes roles in shaping the project during its early stages. Together, they were allocated access to as much as 10% of the total MOVE token supply in signed memoranda of understanding that insiders say were intentionally kept off the books. Thapaliya, the CEO of Zebec Protocol and an early advisor to Manche and Scanlon, was loaned 5% of MOVE’s supply for marketing and market-making purposes, according to one of the agreements obtained by CoinDesk. A second agreement allocated Thapaliya 2.5% of the token's total supply, worth more than $50 million at recent prices. Movement Labs told CoinDesk the signed agreements with Thapaliya were not binding, but Thapaliya claimed the agreements \"were never voided.\" While framed as memoranda of understanding — normally considered non-binding — the agreements examined by CoinDesk also include provisions stating \"both parties\" must consent to their termination. \"I plan on pursuing legally to exercise my claim to retrieve 2.5% of tokens,\" Thapaliya said. Employees at Movement referred to Thapaliya as a “shadow co-founder” and said he was often consulted by Scanlon and Manche for major decisions. His name also surfaced in internal communications regarding Movement’s deal with Web3Port. The Chinese market maker was later blamed for dumping $38 million in tokens after MOVE’s debut — an event that triggered a sell-off and Binance account bans. The amount loaned to Web3Port, 5% of MOVE's supply, was identical to the amount loaned to Thapaliya per the agreement. When contacted by CoinDesk in advance of the initial investigation, Thapaliya denied having any financial interest in Movement Labs or the Movement Foundation. He also denied involvement in the Web3Port deal. In later messages on Signal, Thapaliya told CoinDesk that his work with Movement was consistent with their agreement: “As per the contract signed in February 2023, I fulfilled the agreed terms by supporting Cooper [Scanlon] in exchange-related discussions, strategizing token allocation, assisting with market maker selection, and helping hire the team that audited his airdrop model.” The use of informal agreements to quietly allocate tokens to insiders reflects a broader pattern within the crypto industry, where large sums can change hands without appearing in official fundraising disclosures. In 2024, CoinDesk reported that Eclipse — another project linked to Thapaliya — secretly allocated 5% of its token supply to an employee at Polychain, a major crypto venture firm that later invested in the project. Polychain is also an investor in Movement Labs. Eclipse's deal with the Polychain employee was scrapped following the publication of CoinDesk's investigation. What these cases illustrate is not necessarily fraud, but the ease with which crypto startups can make significant financial commitments behind closed doors — commitments that can later shape the trajectory of an entire token ecosystem, often without the community or even some employees ever knowing. One person familiar with the matter said Movement's agreements were tailored to explicitly avoid disclosures to investors or community members. In another 2023 agreement obtained by CoinDesk, Movement Labs agrees to give an entity linked to Vinit Parekh, \"Digital Incubation Group,\" $50,000 annually for every $1 million raised by Movement Labs — a sum that would total approximately $2 million per year, based on Movement’s $38 million in funding. Another agreement granted a separate Parekh entity control of 2.5% of the MOVE token supply. In exchange for his allocation, Parekh’s firm, Digital Incubation Group, was tasked with a broad mandate, including: “development of strategy framework, validated by relevant stakeholders; consultation through the pre-seed raise process (including advice and connection to investors), close seed raise; development of tokenomics and release plan; engage in structuring team pre-product launch.” Like Thapaliya’s agreements, Parekh's were structured as memoranda of understanding with a termination clause requiring consent from both \"parties.\" Parekh and Movement Labs both said the agreements were exploratory and that funds never changed hands between either party. Two people close to Movement Labs said that Parekh, a Microsoft product manager-turned blockchain industry consultant, was nonetheless a frequent presence at Movement's San Francisco office and played a role in the company's hiring, marketing, and strategy decisions. \"I just care about the ecosystem,\" Parekh told CoinDesk in an interview. \"No money was given to me or to anyone I know,\" in connection to the agreements, \"[b]ut I did help them on the marketing strategy and understanding how to do go-to-market.\" The fallout from Movement’s market-making scandal has exposed a widening rift between its co-founders, Manche and Scanlon. After an excerpt from one of the Thapaliya agreements leaked on X, Manche pointed to Scanlon’s signature on the memo, highlighting his former partner’s role in approving the deal. He also reposted a message questioning whether Movement Labs was “throwing [Manche] under the bus” while Scanlon “played innocent.” Manche was ousted from Movement Labs earlier this month, shortly after CoinDesk reported he had helped coordinate the project’s controversial market-making agreement with Web3Port and an intermediary known as Rentech — a third party that Movement later claimed misrepresented itself in the deal. CoinDesk has since learned that Manche also played a role in facilitating a separate arrangement between Web3Port and Kaito, another crypto project that shares the same director and general counsel as Movement Foundation. A contract reviewed by CoinDesk shows that OpenKaito Foundation loaned 2.5% of its KAITO token supply to \"Whisper,\" an entity linked to Web3Port. The agreement — which was also leaked on X by an anonymous account — was terminated shortly after it was signed, according to an X post from Kaito founder Yu Hu. Unlike the Movement deal, it did not include terms that experts said incentivized pump-and-dump behavior. A person familiar with the matter said Manche introduced Kaito to Rentech, which then connected the project to Web3Port. The controversy has already dented Movement’s reputation in an industry that once saw the startup as a rising star. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, announced it would suspend trading of the MOVE token on May 15. The token’s price fell by 50% in the following week. On May 7, Movement Labs said it would spin out a new entity, Move Industries, to serve as the network’s primary developer. Scanlon remains with the organization but has stepped down as CEO.

        "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Imagine two major newspapers both endorsing the same presidential candidate. The joint support indicates that the candidate probably has a broad backing. Similarly, when price charts for both bitcoin BTC$103,080.59 and Strategy (MSTR) — the largest publicly-listed BTC holder — show concurrent bullish signals, it’s likely a strong sign that the market and major institutional players are aligned. Daily price charts for both BTC and MSTR show their 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) crossing above their 100-day SMA to confirm a so-called bullish crossover. It's a sign the short-term trend is now outperforming the longer-term trend, which could be a signal of the beginning of a major bull market. BTC's bull cross is consistent with other indicators like the MACD, suggesting the path of least resistance is on the higher side. That said, an interim drop below $100,000 cannot be ruled out, as on-chain data show influential market participants have turned cautious. The chart shows BTC's price rally has stalled in the $101,000-$107,000 range. A downside break could trigger more profit-taking, potentially deepening the bull market pullback to support at $98,000.  Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.  Omkar previously worked at FXStreet, writing research on currency markets and as fundamental analyst at currency and commodities desk at Mumbai-based brokerage houses. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot. About Contact",

The integration means that users of “every crypto wallet” will be able to access virtual Mastercards that draw directly from their stablecoin balances. The cards can be used at any merchant in Mastercard’s network. The rollout comes amid a broader trend. Mastercard has last month unveiled end-to-end stablecoin capabilities as it moves deeper into the cryptocurrency economy, and partnered with OKX to launch a debit card with the exchange. Similarly, crypto exchange Kraken teamed up with Mastercard to let its users in the UK and Europe spend their cryptocurrency at any merchant in the payments giant’s network. Earlier this year, Mastercard also began supporting tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on its network through a partnership with Ondo Finance, which offers tokenized U.S. Treasury bills.

        "content": "Venture capital firm a16z Crypto has led a $7 million seed round for KYD Labs, a blockchain-based ticketing platform aimed at giving artists and venues control over ticket sales, fan data, and revenue.  The investment comes as KYD looks to expand its presence in the live event space, already showing success at iconic venues like New York’s Le Poisson Rouge (LPR), the firm said in a press release. Founded by Ahmed Nimale, a former product manager at Ticketmaster, and David Barrick, creator of the ad-tech platform Flipmass, KYD Labs is looking to address long-standing issues in ticketing: lost revenues by artists and venues. Typically, artists and venues lose out on revenue as secondary sales and ticket platforms control customer data. KYD aims to change that by offering venues direct access to fan insights and revenue streams. \"We built KYD, which stands for 'Keep Your Distribution,' to make sure no artist or venue ever has to ask again for something that is rightfully theirs,\" said Nimale, who is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  KYD's platform, built on Solana, offers a streamlined ticket-buying experience. Fans can purchase tickets in under 30 seconds with just a phone number, bypassing crypto wallet complexities.  Venues see increased engagement and revenue—LPR reported a 30% rise in ticket sales and millions in additional income since adopting KYD’s system. \"Since adopting KYD’s tools, we’ve been able to double our return on investment and significantly improve overall efficiency,\" said Shannon Wiles, Marketing Director at LPR. The platform also plans to roll out two new protocol layers: the $KYD token to provide capital for venues and tours, and the $TIX reward token to incentivize fan loyalty, functioning similarly to airline miles. These features are designed to strengthen financial stability for artists and venues while fostering community engagement. KYD has processed $4 million in ticket sales and earned over $1 million in revenue within the past year. It plans to expand to more than 100 U.S. venues by 2026 and eventually aims to power live event commerce at major arenas worldwide. By leveraging blockchain for ticketing, KYD Labs is positioning itself as a modern alternative to traditional ticketing giants, promising greater autonomy for creators and a smoother experience for fans.

        "content": "Bitlayer, a bitcoin Layer 2 based on the BitVM paradigm, and Sui blockchain have teamed up to make bitcoin (BTC) more useful in the Sui ecosystem. The collaboration involves Sui integrating Bitlayer’s BitVM bridge to launch Peg-BTC (YBTC), a Bitcoin-backed token, on its platform, according to an exclusive announcement shared with CoinDesk. It allows bitcoin holders to transfer their BTC into Sui via the BitVM bridge. The bridged version, Peg-BTC, can then be used within Sui’s DeFi ecosystem to earn additional yields. \"Bitcoin’s dominance as a store of value is unmatched, but its utility in DeFi remains untapped. By integrating Bitcoin’s liquidity into Sui’s ecosystem, Peg-BTC (YBTC) empowers users to earn yield while maintaining direct exposure to BTC’s value—a paradigm shift for BTCFi,” Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer, said in a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk. BitcoinFi, or allowing BTC users to earn additional yields through DeFi, was one of the hottest topics at the Token2049 conference in Dubai. Franklin Templeton backed the idea at the event, saying it will boost BTC's appeal beyond the long-prevalent store of value story. Bitlayer is the Bitcoin-security equivalent Layer 2 built on the BitVM paradigm to bring smart contract capabilities to bitcoin without influencing its core consensus. It relies on off-chain computation and on-chain fraud proofs to keep the network secure and decentralized. Bitlayer's BitVM-powered zk bridge is a special tool that facilitates safe and secure movement of BTC onto different blockchain ecosystems without relying on centralized intermediaries or middlemen. It’s trust-minimized, meaning it’s designed to be very secure and decentralized. Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain focusing on offering high-speed and low-cost transactions through parallel processing. As of writing, its DeFi ecosystem comprised 49 projects, boasting over $2 billion in crypto deposits, per data source DeFiLlama. Integrating Peg-BTC (YBTC) into the Sui ecosystem opens up several new opportunities for users, like staking Peg-BTC to earn interest through various Bitcoin staking protocols. Users can also lend or borrow Peg-BTC by lending it out to earn yields or using it as collateral for loans. Additionally, Peg-BTC can be traded on popular decentralized exchanges within Sui, allowing users to swap and provide liquidity to earn trading fees. Hu said they plan to work with Sui's top protocols, with the biggest traction in terms of total value locked, fully diluted value and user base within the Sui ecosystem. Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO at Mysten Labs, the company behind Sui, said they are taking a holistic approach while catering to the growing demand for BitcoinFi. \"Sui is taking a holistic approach by onboarding a full stack of infrastructure and BTCfi asset options into the ecosystem, including staking, restaking, bridge integrations, WBTC, sBTC, and soon Peg-BTC (YBTC). Demand is growing for Bitcoin to serve a greater purpose beyond simply being held,\" Abiodun told CoinDesk. \"Key integrations, such as the BitVM bridge with Bitlayer, are transforming the experience for Bitcoin holders by enabling them to earn, engage with DeFi, and put their assets to work on Sui,\" Abiodun added. As of today, BTC assets comprise over 10% of the total TVL locked in the Sui ecosystem, with over 587 BTC flowing into DeFi since February. \"With support for leading BTCfi integrations, Sui’s advanced programmability activates Bitcoin’s utility, enabling users to move beyond holding and into a secure, high-performance chain,\" Abiodun noted.

        "content": "Tokyo-listed investment firm Metaplanet (3350) generated 592 million yen ($4 million) in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025, largely through bitcoin-based income strategies. The company reported 877 million yen in revenue, with 88% coming from option premium harvesting on bitcoin BTC$103,080.59, according to its first quarter earnings release. Metaplanet’s bitcoin stash grew by more than 5,000 BTC in the quarter to reach 6,796 BTC. The firm has achieved 68% of its 10,000 BTC target just over four months after adopting its bitcoin standard on April 8, 2024, according to the document. This aggressive accumulation has helped it become the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and the top in Asia. The company recently overtook El Salvador in the metric. To finance its BTC accumulation, Metaplanet sold bonds, issued equity, and sold moving-strike stock warrants that only activate when share prices rise. The company raised 86.1 billion yen through this mechanism, becoming the largest public equity issuer in Japan so far this year. Metaplanet’s capital strategy hinges on leveraging operating cash flow and market-raised funds into bitcoin, boosting its BTC Yield, a metric tracking bitcoin per fully diluted share. That figure jumped 170% year-to-date. Metaplanet’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange went down 2.47% in the last trading session to 593 yen each. The firm’s shares are up 65.8% year-to-date, while BTC is up 8.45% over the same period. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) rally has paused above $100K, slowing the recovery rallies in major altcoins. But one coin stands resilient: monero (XMR), the world's largest privacy-focused digital asset by market value. XMR has risen 4.6% this week to $347, with prices gaining 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency has outshone every other top 100 token by market value in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the market leader, has dropped 1.6% in the past 24 hours, taking the weekly decline to 2%. Monero’s performance is even more impressive, considering its 110% recovery from the low of $165, hit during the early April sell-off when bitcoin dropped to $75,000. XMR's price charts had signaled the meteoric rise with a bullish golden cross a month ago. The rally can be attributed to several factors, including a favorable regulatory outlook, according to HTX. \"In the U.S., the regulatory outlook has shifted as the FIT21 crypto legislation advances and the SEC shows increasing ambiguity in classifying certain tokens, easing market concerns over privacy coin regulation and prompting cautious capital inflows,\" analysts at HTX Research told CoinDesk. The impending Full-Chain Membership Proofs(FCMP++) upgrade, a new and more powerful privacy feature integration, due later this year, may also be galvanizing investor interest. \"FCMP++ enhances Monero’s quantum resistance by providing forward secrecy, ensuring that a quantum adversary cannot break the privacy of past transactions even if they solve the ECDLP. By replacing ring signatures with full chain membership proofs, it eliminates vulnerabilities that quantum computers could exploit to deanonymize transactions,\" Monero society member @DatCryptoPiggie said on X. Here is an analogy to help one understand the above. Imagine having a personal diary with a lock, but there's a risk of someone developing a super-smart device to crack the lock. FCMP++ is likely an added layer of smart lock that will protect currency entries while ensuring that a potential entity managing to bypass the security tricks can't see past entries. HTX also pointed to rumors of major exchanges looking to list XMR as a source of bullish pressure for the cryptocurrency. \"Rumors that major exchanges are considering relisting some privacy coins have further boosted sentiment,\" HTX analysts said. \"Given their lower liquidity and concentrated holdings, privacy coins exhibit higher price elasticity than major cryptocurrencies, often resulting in more extreme price movements when capital enters the market.\" Lastly, some observers have suggested that the recent suspected BTC theft of $330 million may have been laundered through XMR, leading to a bullish price action.

        "content": "Solana (SOL) is starting to see capital flow back in after several weeks of outflows. Glassnode data shows SOL's 30-day realized cap inflows are now firmly back in positive territory, growing at a pace of 4–5%, a level that puts it on par with XRP. While the inflows are relatively modest compared to frenzied periods in December and January, the move marks a trend reversal following a prolonged stretch of realized losses and capital outflows that reflected investor exit and fading conviction. Realized cap inflow is a metric used to gauge actual capital entering or exiting an asset, based on the USD value of coins as they last moved on-chain. It filters out noise from speculative price spikes and instead tracks where holders are actually deploying capital. For Solana, that number turning green again could indicate that buy-side pressure is finally returning, even if price action hasn’t fully reflected it. Inflows into realized cap often serve as a leading indicator, suggesting some traders are positioning ahead of a potential bounce, or at the very least, a sign that capitulation has run its course.

        "content": "Banks need to be part of crypto for stablecoins to succeed—that was the message from Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s senior vice president of digital currencies, during a panel discussion at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. \"It might sound counterintuitive, but you do want the banks in this space,\" Fernandez da Ponte said, adding that their infrastructure—from custody to providing fiat rails—will be essential if stablecoins are to scale beyond crypto-native circles. \"You want that connectivity and that fabric to work.\" His remarks came amid efforts to bring regulatory clarity for digital assets in the U.S., with lawmakers inching closer to pass stablecoin legislation that could redefine the market and allow banks to enter the space. Read more: U.S. Senate's Stablecoin Push Still Alive as Bill May Return to Floor: Sources \"This is going to be a big unlock,\" said Anthony Soohoo, chairman and CEO of MoneyGram, a cross-border money transfer service. \"There’s always hesitation: Can I trust this? [The stablecoin legislation] is going to answer a lot of those questions.\" Both executives said they expect a wave of new issuers to enter the market once regulation is in place, followed by a period of consolidation. “It’s not going to be 300 stablecoins, and it’s not going to be just two,” Fernandez da Ponte said. Currently, Tether's USDT USDT$1.00 and Circle's USDC USDC$0.99996 dominate the market, representing nearly 90% of the $230 billion asset class. PayPal’s PYUSD PYUSD$0.99926, launched in 2023, lags far behind with $900 million supply. Fernandez da Ponte pushed back on market cap as the primary metric for success. \"We look at velocity, active wallets, number of transactions,” he said. “Those are what drive real usage.\" In countries with high inflation and volatile currencies, consumers are seeking out dollar-backed stablecoins as stores of value and tools for cross-border payments. Soohoo said MoneyGram, which operates in over 200 countries with nearly half a million cash-access locations, is helping facilitate that access. \"We see ourselves between physical finance and digital finance,\" Soohoo said. \"A lot of consumers in local economies want to hold value in dollars but still need to access it as cash to spend in places that don’t take digital currency.\" Stablecoin adoption in developed countries, meanwhile, has been slower. With clear regulation in place, stablecoins can streamline corporate treasury operations and cross-border disbursement, Fernandez da Ponte noted. \"We used to have this mad rush on Friday to make sure money was in the right places before the weekend,\" he said. \"Now we’re sending money to the Philippines and Africa in ten minutes with stablecoins.\" Both executives noted that real-world use cases, not hype, will determine if stablecoins could reach the trillion-dollar scale in the next years that's been projected. \"Consumers don’t care about stablecoins. They care about solving problems.\" Fernandez da Ponte said. \"We’re five years into a ten-year journey, and regulation will define the next half.\" Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

At a panel at Consensus 2025, Ari Redbord discussed how easy it is for hacks to happen on crypto exchanges, as the industry is “the perfect storm of weak cyber controls and ultimately it's a good target.” Coinbase shared earlier on Thursday that some of its staff had been bribed to steal their customers' data, and its founder Brian Armstrong had received a ransome note for $20 million dollars in bitcoin. The team shared in a blog post that because of the breach, it could pay up to $400 million in remediation costs to affected customers, and that they were setting up a $20 million bounty on any information related to the attackers instead. The news comes as the industry has experienced other major hacks, like Bybit which was hacked earlier this year for $1.5 billion, and defunct crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 for $400 million. Though these episodes seem to happen frequently, Redbord believes more regulatory involvement can alleviate some of these issues. “There's a lot we can do with governments in order to go after these bad actors that have nothing to do with crypto or blockchain intelligence,” he said. “We have cyber facilities.” Read more: Coinbase Could Pay Customers Up to $400M for Data Breach Margaux Nijkerk reports on the Ethereum protocol and L2s.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 18:52:54 +0000",
        "content": "The latest draft of the U.S. Senate's stablecoin legislation includes enough changes that Democratic senators may now have an easier time getting back on board, though consumer advocates say it still falls short. The bill to set oversight and standards for stablecoin issuers sailed through the Senate Banking Committee with wide bipartisan support in March, but it hit a wall on the Senate floor last week as many Democrats raised objections. Chief among them were the conflicts that may be presented by President Donald Trump's own crypto interests and the possibility that big technology firms like Meta and social-media site X may be able to issue such tokens.  \"As the result of hard-fought negotiations, Democrats won major victories on a range of critical issues,\" proponents noted in a summary circulated with the draft bill. The question remaining is: Will it be enough to get back to a so-called cloture vote that will advance the bill to a floor debate that would mark its final major stage before the Senate takes a vote. The next procedural move on the Senate floor could come by next week, according to people familiar with the talks. The latest changes to the bill represent a mixed bag. The loudest requests from critics, that the president be explicitly stopped from personally benefiting from the crypto industry that his administration will regulate, were not directly addressed in this version of the bill. But on the concerns over tech giants sprouting with a field of new dollar-based tokens, the bill dealt with it in part: \"A public company that is not predominantly engaged in one or more financial activities, and its wholly or majority owned subsidiaries or affiliates, may not issue a payment stablecoin unless the public company obtains a unanimous vote of the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee,\" according to the latest draft. The committee would be a multi-agency group created under the legislation to look at such requests. There are major loopholes in that, according to Mark Hays, who focuses on crypto and financial-technology issues for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. For starters, he said, it affects only public companies and not private ones, such as X and TiKTok. \"There's already a way that large tech firms that aren't public could become issuers without adhering to these new standards,\" he said. Also, he added, \"it's quite possible under this bill that a public company could secure an interest in a non-public company, and that's another way around it.\" He argued that this overall draft gave toothless answers to the concern of consumer advocates. \"Pushing this through on an arbitrary deadline because the crypto industry is breathing down your neck is not a good way to make policy,\" Hays said. \"And it's especially bad when that policy could further enable and enrich the president.\" Bo Hines, one of Trump's chief advisers on crypto, appeared at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Wednesday to insist that there's no conflict in the president's business interests or his family's involvement in the industry, including its stake in World Liberty Financial. He said that Trump \"can't be bought.\" The White House's Hines, who acts as a liaison to Capitol Hill during the legislative negotiations, expressed continued confidence about the effort staying on track in the Senate. \"Negotiations are ongoing,\" Hines said at Consensus. \"But I remain steadfast in my optimism that we're going to achieve — the president's desire is to do it — both stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.\" Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

        "content": "The SEC has been investigating crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) over whether it misstated its user numbers in past securities filings and marketing materials.  The probe began under the former presidential administration while the SEC was still under the control of then-Chair Gary Gensler, according to the NYT, which first reported the story, but has persisted under the SEC’s current, crypto-friendly leadership. The metric at the heart of the investigation is Coinbase’s claim to have over 100 million “verified users.” It stopped using the metric in both disclosure and marketing materials in 2021, the year it went public on the Nasdaq. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement that the SEC’s investigation is a “hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public.” “We explained that the verified users metric includes anyone who verified their email address or phone number with us, so it may overstate the number of unique customers,\" said Grewal \"We also disclosed – and continue to disclose – the more relevant metric of ‘monthly transacting users’ – the number of people who use our platform in a given month.\" “While we strongly believe this investigation should not continue, we remain committed to working with the SEC to bring this matter to a close,” Grewal added. The SEC did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time. Already under pressure due to today's disclosure of a data breach, COIN shares dipped a bit further on this SEC news, now down 6.6% on the session.

        "content": "TORONTO —Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, said he believes bitcoin is digital gold and called the largest digital currency a store of value, during a packed panel at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  \"I really believe in digital gold, which is bitcoin, right? I believe in the store of value,\" Trump said. However, Eric Trump — who has a background in real estate — told the crowd at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto that he didn't get into bitcoin or crypto until politics intertwined the Trump family and the crypto community. \"It wasn't until the very same group that was attacking my family for no reason whatsoever other than political beliefs, started attacking [the] crypto community that it really drove two people who might not have always been like-minded together and that partnership has been absolutely amazing,\" he said Thursday. Aside from politics, he also realized real estate is not as liquid as bitcoin, which has better liquidity and was easier to transact, solidifying his belief in the digital currency. \"I also realized, kind of, through some of that political weaponization, you know, some of the limitations of real estate. Real estate has created tremendous wealth for our family. At the same time, real estate can't be transferred. It's very hard to sell,\" he said. \"I sold a hotel two years ago. It took me a year and a half to literally transact that hotel because you have title reports and you have managers that have to go in, and you have best proliferations. You do all sorts of things,\" Trump said. \"... You constantly have to manage it. You constantly have to watch operations, right? And then all of a sudden, you've got this kind of digital asset which you don't need to watch, you don't need to manage. You know, it's easy to transact on.\" Trump is the co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining firm founded in partnership with Hut 8 and slated to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). The Gryphon partnership came about from a desire to take the American Bitcoin partnership public as quickly as possible, said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot on stage alongside Trump to a standing-room only crowd. An existing mining business was a key part of that plan as well as getting 'American' and 'bitcoin' as part of the company name.  \"American Bitcoin, to me, is everything, you know. And I we came up with the name, I said one thing. I said, Listen, it has to have the word American, and it has to have the word Bitcoin in it,\" Trump said.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant fluctuations as global economic factors and regulatory developments create both challenges and opportunities. Litecoin's recent price action reflects this broader market sentiment, with the cryptocurrency encountering strong resistance at $101.65 after reaching a peak of $101.90. Despite the subsequent correction to the $95-$96 range, LTC has shown resilience with support emerging around $95.82.  Market analysts point to the recent US-China tariff agreement as a key driver behind Litecoin's price movements, with the cryptocurrency gaining bullish momentum following the deal announcement. Additionally, Federal Reserve policy decisions have contributed to positive sentiment in risk assets, helping LTC maintain its position above critical support levels despite the correction.  In the regulatory landscape, the SEC has delayed decisions on spot ETF applications for several cryptocurrencies including Litecoin, creating uncertainty but also anticipation. Despite these delays, betting markets show ~80% probability for approval before year-end, suggesting continued optimism among investors. This regulatory environment, combined with increasing institutional adoption and cross-border transaction utility, positions Litecoin as a significant player in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio shared Thursday that he thinks the blockchain wasn’t necessarily meant to be a “competitor to Bitcoin,” but rather “it was meant to be an alternative.” Speaking to a crowd at Consensus 2025, Di Iorio shared with the audience about his time during Ethereum’s early days, noting back then that he understood that the project could become a really big movement. “We could sense and feel that it was picking up,” Di Iorio said. Di Iorio was one of the eight co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, but originally got into cryptocurrency through his advocacy with Bitcoin. He started Bitcoin meetups in Toronto in 2012, and through that met Vitalik Buterin, who came up with the Ethereum whitepaper and shared it with his fellow co-founders. While Di Iorio is still a big Bitcoin proponent, he has said that “I do think eventually Ethereum has a possibility of overtaking it in terms of market capitalization.” “With the amount of use cases, and the value that Ethereum is allowing to be created, I think it has that opportunity, in order to possibly overtake it,” Di Iorio added. After stepping away from the Ethereum Foundation, Anthony Di Iorio founded Decentral in 2014, which is best known for creating the Jaxx Liberty crypto wallet. In 2022, he launched Andiami, a project blending hardware, tokenomics, and game theory to tackle centralization vectors within decentralized networks.

        "content": "Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Leary Ventures, said the crypto industry isn’t regulated enough — which is holding digital assets back from true institutional adoption. Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Thursday, O’Leary said crypto assets under management (AUM) have hit a wall, which he attributed to a lack of regulatory clarity that has prevented the majority of sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and institutional investors from investing meaningfully. “I never thought I’d say this, but I want more regulation and I want it now,” O’Leary said. “The good news is there’s a new sheriff in town: Paul Atkins at the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission].” O’Leary said Atkins, who was sworn in as chairman of the SEC last month, has already telegraphed that he’s friendly to the crypto industry and will “regulate accordingly.” Atkins replaces Gary Gensler, whose penchant for so-called “regulation by enforcement” drew the ire of many in the crypto industry. O’Leary said Thursday that he respected Gensler’s consistency as a regulator. “He said he was gonna sue you, and he sued you,” O’Leary said. “He was consistent and you have to respect that.” In a press conference ahead of his keynote speech, O’Leary said he'd received a Wells notice from the SEC over a decade ago after speaking about debt tokenization in a televised interview. He was cleared, he said, but the experience temporarily scared him off engaging with crypto in the U.S. “My first experience with crypto was over a decade ago, when I was on business cable, talking about debt tokenization,” O’Leary said. “I get a knock on my door and it’s an enforcement agent from the SEC serving me a Wells notice. I shit my pants … The regulator was sending a message. I got the message” Since Gensler departed the agency in January, the SEC has done an about-face on its approach to crypto regulation, creating a Crypto Task Force spearheaded by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce and dropping a host of open investigations and lawsuits against crypto companies that were started under Gensler. A friendlier SEC isn’t the only thing O’Leary is hopeful for when it comes to crypto regulation — he expects to see the passage of the GENIUS Act within “months.” “The minute that happens, it will signal the move to the next act, the market infrastructure act,” O’Leary said. “And when that is determined and regulated, Katy, bar the doors — a trillion dollars will come in and index [bitcoin].” On the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime.

        "content": "The daughter and grandson of a French crypto exchange CEO were targeted in a failed kidnap attempt, adding to the growing number of crypto-related kidnapping cases in the country, France 24 reported on Tuesday. A video widely shared on social media showed the attempt, in which three masked men wrestled the woman and another person to the ground in Paris. A shop owner intervened, waving a fire extinguisher, and the attackers gave up, driving off in two waiting vans. France 24 identified the crypto exchange as Paymium. The attack follows earlier — successful — kidnappings in the country. In January, David Ballard, a co-founder of crypto-wallet developer Ledger, was ransomed after being kidnapped with his wife from their home. In May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was kidnapped and rescued days later. Four suspects were arrested at the time, the BBC reported. Both of the men had a finger chopped off. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Wednesday he plans to meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to discuss how to protect them following the surge of kidnappers targeting wealthy people with crypto ties in France. The Paris prosecutors office opened an investigation into the attack, Reuters reported. \"These units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,\" Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin said at Consensus on Wednesday in response to a question on the worldwide kidnapping for ransom trend. \"I think that the message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable.\" Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

After establishing resistance at $6.780, UNI cascaded downward with multiple high-volume selling periods, breaking below critical support levels, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. This volatility comes as blockchain data reveals large institutional holders transferred substantial UNI positions to centralized exchanges, with two addresses moving 11.65 million tokens ($82.38M) to Coinbase Prime.Technical Analysis Highlights Disclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

        "link": "https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/15/u-s-senate-s-stablecoin-push-still-alive-as-bill-may-return-to-floor-sources",
        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:41:37 +0000",
        "content": "After a suddenly rocky road for the U.S. legislative effort to regulate stablecoin issuers, the Senate is poised to move forward again with newly polished language in the bill that may see some procedural movement as soon as Thursday. The Senate's stablecoin push veered off course a week ago when Democrats objected, primarily to President Donald Trump's personal crypto business interests, but the lawmakers continued negotiations and are said to be close to an agreement on updated text to the \"Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins\" (GENIUS) Act, according to people familiar with the talks. The bill would establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of another asset, such as Tether's USDT$1.00 and Circle's USDC$0.99989, and there's a similar one grinding its way through the House of Representatives. A previous version of the bill advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support earlier this year, giving the crypto sector confidence that it would probably meet with little resistance on the Senate floor. However, the text was updated and the Senate failed to advance the bill into its final stage, a process known as cloture in which 60 senators need to agree to move legislation to an open floor debate. Every Democrat and two Republicans voted against it (a third Republican, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, originally supported the cloture motion but flipped his vote at the last minute in a procedural move to keep the legislation alive). That left the stablecoin bill in legislative limbo, but people familiar with the negotiation told CoinDesk that it may soon be back on track. The next vote would likely be a procedural action to buy lawmakers more time to negotiate specifics of the bill than a cloture motion, two of the people said. One of the central points of contention for Democrats was President Trump's increasing forays into crypto, particularly after Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX announced it would close its purchase of a stake in global exchange Binance using USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, which in turn is linked to Trump and his children. However, the bill's text, which hasn't yet been released publicly, is unlikely to include any provisions addressing this potential conflict of interest. Senator Gillibrand, the New York Democrat who has been working on crypto legislation for years, suggested at a Stand With Crypto event on Wednesday that the latest version still doesn't focus directly on Trump. \"This bill does have some ethics requirements that I think are really strong and very good, but it's not an ethics bill per se, and if we were dealing with all President Trump's ethics problems, it would be a very long and detailed bill,\" she said.  She said she's \"very optimistic we will have a vote soon enough.\" At the same event, Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Republican chair of a digital assets subcommittee in the Senate and a frequent partner to Gillibrand on crypto regulation, argued against lawmakers being distracted by the \"shiny object that's out in the corner.\" \"I don't want the fact that President Trump's name comes up in relation to this to distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry that is being used to provide a new market for US Treasuries that helps the dollar stay the world reserve currency,\" Lummis said. Bo Hines, Trump's executive director for the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto on Wednesday that \"negotiations are ongoing\" when asked about a possible vote on Thursday. He indicated that he thinks the legislation will keep moving. \"We shall see,\" he said.

        "content": "Berachain is focused on building “decorrelated populations” of users to guard against market reflexivity, said Smokey the Bera, theblockchain’s pseudonymous founder, onstage at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2025 event in Toronto. Reflexivity is a big concern in decentralised finance and crypto. It refers to the self-reinforcing effect of market sentiment. Rising prices often attract buyers and create a positive feedback loop. However, the same process can operate in reverse leading to a catastrophic collapse in prices. Berachain’s plan for the second and third quarters is to support profitable businesses that exist in web2 and are uncorrelated to the existing DeFi and crypto markets. Doing so will help Berachain guard against reflexivity, helping it weather market volatility and retain deep liquidity, Smokey said. Smokey was joined by Jason Atkins from market making firm Auros, when they discussed all things to do with liquidity — essentially how easily and quickly a crypto asset can be bought or sold without a significant impact on its price. Tim reports on all things DeFi. He came to CoinDesk from DL News where he published over 400 articles covering everything from institutional adoption to DAO governance. He reported extensively on North Korea’s $1.4 billion theft from crypto exchange Bybit and documented its impact across the crypto industry. He also conducted multiple investigations into alleged crypto scams, and his reporting on Waves was cited in a lawsuit filed by the FTX Recovery Trust against the blockchain’s founder Sasha Ivanov. His previous reporting on the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was also cited in documents submitted to the High Court of Singapore. Disclosure: Tim holds over $1,000 worth of Ethereum. About Contact",

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:00:00 +0000",
        "content": "0x, a decentralized exchange infrastructure firm, announced the acquisition of rival Flood, a move the firm says will help it compete in the hyper competitive aggregation market. Decentralized exchanges — or DEXs — are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. They let blockchain users swap between assets without the need for an intermediary or middleman such as a centralized exchange. Aggregators like 0x’s act as a one-stop-shop for traders, searching all the DEXs out there to find the one that offers the most cost-efficient trades, for a small fee. Competition is fierce and often exists on razor-thin margins. It was Flood’s proprietary aggregation software that motivated the acquisition, Amir Bandeali, CEO of 0x, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. 0x uses its own trade simulation technology to check how well its aggregation software works compared with its competitors, Bandeali said. “We were able to take a look at Flood as well and run similar types of tests and we were very impressed with the data that we saw.” “Everything got made from scratch,” Francesco Baccetti, co-founder and CEO of Flood, told CoinDesk. “We rewrote the whole stack to get this level of performance that we now have.” The acquisition is 0x’s first since the firm’s founding in 2017. A spokesperson for 0x declined to share how much it paid for Flood, citing contractual obligations. Flood raised $5.2 million from investors in a February 2024 seed funding round. DEX aggregators are a big business. Over the past week, the top 12 aggregators facilitated almost $10 billion worth of swap volume, around 10% of all on-chain trading, according to data compiled by Fredrik Haga, co-founder of Dune Analytics. Aggregators with tradable tokens are valued at a combined $2.3 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 0x is one of the oldest DEX aggregators. But it’s not the largest. On Ethereum and other compatible blockchains, 1inch and CoW Swap consistently handle the most trading volume among aggregators, while on Solana, Jupiter dominates. Bandeali said he’s hopeful that by combining the two companies' technologies, 0x will be able to win market share from larger aggregators on both Ethereum and Solana. Another motivation for the acquisition was Flood’s team of developers. “This is a pretty niche domain,” Bandeali said, explaining that it's very difficult for his firm to find talented developers who specialize in aggregation and trade routing. Having the right developers therefore is crucial to an aggregator’s continued success. “It sounds simple but it’s really complicated,” he said. “It gets more complicated as new chains and new tokens launch.” The reward for proving the best swaps is great. CoW Swap is set to bring in almost $11 million in revenue this year, according to DefiLlama data. (It’s unclear how much revenue 1inch makes, while Jupiter’s projected $162 million in revenue comes from more than just its aggregation services). 0x has also expanded into other areas, such as providing APIs that integrate its aggregator into other products, and trading analytics. But improving its core aggregation product, which powers swaps in apps like Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood, Phantom and Farcaster, is still the main focus. And with DeFi getting more complex by the day, the demand for aggregators is likely to keep increasing. “We’re just trying to abstract away the complexity faster than it’s created for our customers,” Bandeali said.

He came to CoinDesk from DL News where he published over 400 articles covering everything from institutional adoption to DAO governance. He reported extensively on North Korea’s $1.4 billion theft from crypto exchange Bybit and documented its impact across the crypto industry. He also conducted multiple investigations into alleged crypto scams, and his reporting on Waves was cited in a lawsuit filed by the FTX Recovery Trust against the blockchain’s founder Sasha Ivanov. His previous reporting on the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was also cited in documents submitted to the High Court of Singapore.

Learn more. – Sarah Morton When major financial institutions — from Citi and Standard Chartered to Brevan Howard, McKinsey and BCG — rally around a once-niche innovation, it’s a good idea to take note, especially when the innovation is stablecoins, a tokenized representation of money on-chain. What email was to the internet, stablecoin is to blockchain — instant and cost-effective value transfer at a global scale running 24/7. Stablecoin is blockchain’s first killer use case. First introduced by Tether in 2015 and hailed as the first stablecoin, USDT offered early crypto users a way to hold and transfer a stable, dollar-denominated value on-chain. Until then, their only alternative was bitcoin. Tether’s dollar-backed stablecoin made its debut on Bitfinex before rapidly spreading to major exchanges like Binance and OKX. It quickly became the default trading pair across the digital asset ecosystem. As adoption grew, so did its utility. No longer just a trading tool, stablecoin emerged as the primary cash-equivalent for trading, cash management, and payments. Below is the trajectory of stablecoin’s market size since inception, a reflection of its evolution from a crypto niche to a core pillar of digital finance. The reason stablecoins have been a hot topic in finance is their rapid adoption and growth. According to Visa, stablecoin on-chain transaction volume exceeded $5.5 trillion in 2024. By comparison, Visa’s volume was $13.2 trillion while Mastercard transacted $9.7 trillion during the same period. Why such proliferation? Because stable dollar-denominated cash is the lifeblood for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here are 3 major use cases for stablecoin. 1. Digital Assets Trading Given its origins, it's no surprise that trading was stablecoin’s first major use case. What began as a niche tool for value preservation in 2015 is now the beating heart of digital asset trading. Today, stablecoins underpin over $30 trillion in annual trading volume across centralized exchanges, powering the vast majority of spot and derivatives activity. But stablecoin’s impact doesn’t end with centralized exchanges — It is also the liquidity backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Onchain traders need the same reliable cash equivalent for moving in and out of positions. A glance at leading decentralized platforms, such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Hyperliquid, shows that top trading pairs are consistently denominated by stablecoins. Monthly decentralized exchange volumes routinely hit $100-200 billion, according to The Block, further cementing stablecoin’s role as the foundational layer of the modern digital assets market. 2. Real World Assets Real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as bonds and equities. Once a fringe idea, RWAs are now among the fastest-growing asset classes in crypto. Leading this wave is the tokenized U.S. Treasury market, now boasting over $6 billion AUM. Launched in early 2023, these on-chain Treasuries opened the door for crypto-native capital to access the low-risk, short-duration US T-Bills yield. The adoption saw a staggering 6,000% growth according to RWA.xyz: from just $100 million in early 2023 to over $6 billion AUM today. Asset management heavyweights such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity (pending SEC approval) are all creating on-chain treasury products for digital capital markets. Unlike traditional Treasuries, these digital versions offer 24/7 instant mint/redemptions, and seamless composability with other DeFi yield opportunities. Investors can subscribe and redeem around the clock, with stablecoin liquidity delivered in real time. Circle’s facility with BlackRock’s BUIDL and PayPal’s integration with Ondo’s OUSG are just two prominent examples. 3. Payment A major emerging use case for stablecoins is cross-border payment, especially in corridors underserved by traditional financial infrastructure. In much of the world, international payments remain slow, expensive, and error-prone due to dependency on correspondent banking. By contrast, stablecoins offer merchants and consumers an alternative with its instant, low-cost, always-on transfers. According to research from a16z, stablecoin payments are 99.99% cheaper and 99.99% faster than traditional wire transfers and they settle 24/7. The shift is gaining momentum in the West, too. Stripe’s $1 billion acquisition of Bridge and subsequent introduction of Stablecoin Financial Account signal the start of mainstream global adoption. Meanwhile, PayPal’s rollout of yield on PYUSD balances highlights stablecoin’s rise as a legitimate retail payment vertical. What was once a crypto-native solution is fast becoming a global financial utility. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q. In light of the recent news from Europe regarding stablecoins and Tether, can you explain how stablecoin investment is valuable to an individual? A. In the inherently volatile and highly risky world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide individuals with a capital-efficient way to gain exposure to digital assets. Pegged to fiat currencies like the euro or commodities like gold, these digital assets provide stability and a hedge against crypto’s volatility. Crypto individuals can park their funds safely in stablecoins during times of uncertainty without having to exit the market and deal with TradFi. This is why stablecoins dominate crypto. Their combined market cap has surpassed $245bln, a massive 15x growth over the last five years. Q. Given current market trends in Europe, are stablecoins more or less susceptible to market fluctuations? A. While stablecoins are inherently less volatile than typical crypto assets, they remain sensitive to regulatory developments and issuer credibility. When it comes to Europe, specifically, stablecoins have become less susceptible to market fluctuations due to stringent regulatory measures. This includes the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a clear legal framework that requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and comply with strict governance standards. Such rules reduce the risk of de-pegging and enhance overall stability. However, this leads to market consolidation, a lack of competition, and reduced innovation at the same time. Q. Is Europe becoming a new stablecoin hub as it becomes more receptive to crypto? A. Europe has been signalling a friendly approach to crypto through MiCA, the first comprehensive crypto framework globally that introduces licensing requirements for digital asset service providers and AML protocols. The aim is to create a structured and harmonized regulatory environment for the crypto market, protect customers, and ensure financial stability. Through its evolving MiCA regulations, Europe could certainly enhance institutional confidence and attract more stablecoin issuers. However, that would require overcoming licensing (a lengthy and costly process) issues, effective implementation at national levels, and adapting to the fast-progressing crypto space. Europe is currently not a global leader in stablecoin adoption, but with clearer rules coming into place and its openness to compliant entities, it is well-positioned to emerge as a key hub for compliant stablecoin innovation. - Trevor Koverko, co-founder, Sapien Harvey Li writes about the business of tokenization and help teams navigate the roadblocks that stall adoption. As the founder of Tokenization Insight, the premier tokenization intelligence & GTM platform for institutions, he has a simple conviction: tokenization will transform global markets but only with the right products, distribution strategies, and communication frameworks in place. He work with leading tokenization teams to position them top-of-mind with key institutional stakeholders and support emerging startups in crafting and executing go-to-market strategies. Clients he's supported include Ondo Finance ($1B+ AUM), Ownera (interoperability partner to DTCC and JPMorgan) and Provenance Blockchain. About Contact",

        "content": "TORONTO — Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, made a case for Canada's new government to create a national crypto strategy during his appearance at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  Speaking on a panel titled, \"What the new Canadian Government Needs to do to Lead In Crypto,\" Matheson outlined some key steps he believes will help position Canada as a leader in the blockchain space. Matheson highlighted that Canada has long been a hub for crypto innovation, citing Ethereum's origins and the strong presence of Web3 developers at Canadian universities.  However, he said the country risks falling behind as other nations actively shape crypto policies. \"We need leadership. We need champions in government to embrace this technology and legitimize it in the eyes of the everyday Canadian,\" Matheson said. He emphasized the importance of having a dedicated federal crypto leader, similar to the U.S. crypto czar. One of his primary suggestions was for Carney to establish a government-led crypto task force within the first 100 days of the new administration.  This task force would develop a national crypto strategy, including defining digital assets, regulating stablecoins, and allowing banks to hold crypto securely. Matheson also proposed creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and integrating crypto mining with existing data centers. Matheson noted that stablecoins could play a key role in making digital assets less speculative, suggesting that Canada needs a stable, Canadian-dollar-denominated coin to boost financial efficiency.  \"One in five Canadians remit money abroad. We pay between 6% and 12% to remit money all around the world. And today, with crypto, you can click different buttons on your phone and send your friends and family 6% to 12% more money,\" he said. Metheson also noted that 15% of Canadians are considered underbanked in Canada, which creates \"a significant opportunity for us to drive innovation and change,\" in the country via crypto.  To further advocate for policy change, Matheson pointed to the \"Stand with Crypto\" initiative.  This aims to educate lawmakers about blockchain's benefits and address misconceptions. He noted that the initiative is gaining traction among industry leaders and aims to build support among the members of Parliament. As Canada transitions to a new government led by Mark Carney, Matheson expressed optimism about the new administration's new mandates regarding innovative technology.  \"They [Liberals] are mandated to build Canada to find economic growth and opportunities for us to embrace technology. And we have a government that is highly motivated to think of opportunities to help our country gain more economic advantage. And I think crypto and other technologies will need to be embraced, and to do that, we need to educate them,\" he said.  However, Matheson cautioned that Canada risks being left behind in the global race to integrate crypto into the financial system unless it takes swift action. He compared the current challenges in Canada as \"a square peg, round hole, legal definitional problem,\" due to several different layers of securities regulators. This means that Canadians are forced to look elsewhere for crypto-related services, potentially resulting in a loss of opportunity for the country and opening users to risks. \"We're at risk for not moving fast enough to embrace the types of technology and products and services in Canada, and as a regulated financial institution, it's a priority for us to make sure that we can introduce these products and services in a compliant way, so that Canadians aren't just using a VPN and jumping off and using non compliant platforms around the world.\" Read more: Coinbase’s Lucas Matheson on Why Canada Needs a Blockchain Strategy Aoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's Head of Americas.

        "content": "Movement Labs, the scandal-plagued crypto startup backed by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial, quietly promised large stakes of its token to early insiders—undisclosed deals that now raise fresh questions about who really holds power behind the scenes. Even before its token launch, Movement Labs committed large portions of MOVE’s supply to a handful of early advisers — arrangements that were never disclosed to investors and only surfaced through internal documents reviewed by CoinDesk. Two business memos obtained by CoinDesk — one promising a single adviser nearly $2 million a year — show how Movement, founded in 2023 by two 20-year-old Vanderbilt dropouts, leaned heavily on these advisers to gain a foothold in the crypto industry. Movement Labs said the agreements, dated shortly after the project's founding, were exploratory in nature and non-binding. The existence of the agreements nonetheless casts new light on the chaotic inner workings of Movement, which came under fire after CoinDesk reported last month that insider market-making deals enabled token dumping by insiders. The fallout has sparked waves of finger-pointing inside the company, centering on who steered Movement into a predatory agreement with a Chinese market maker under terms that analysts say incentivized predatory selling. The tension has boiled over into a public rift between co-founders Rushi Manche, who was terminated by Movement Labs this month, and Cooper Scanlon, who stepped back from his CEO role but remains at the company. “When we started Movement, I was the CTO — leading the engineering team. I left most business decisions, including the contracts, to Cooper,” Manche told CoinDesk when reached for comment. “When priorities changed, our roles changed, but Cooper’s decisions in the early days heavily shaped the way the launch went.” CoinDesk spoke to more than a dozen people familiar with Movement over the course of its investigation, including current and former employees who were granted anonymity so they could speak freely. The agreements obtained by CoinDesk concern Sam Thapaliya and Vinit Parekh, both of whom played behind-the-scenes roles in shaping the project during its early stages. Together, they were allocated access to as much as 10% of the total MOVE token supply in signed memoranda of understanding that insiders say were intentionally kept off the books. Thapaliya, the CEO of Zebec Protocol and an early advisor to Manche and Scanlon, was loaned 5% of MOVE’s supply for marketing and market-making purposes, according to one of the agreements obtained by CoinDesk. A second agreement allocated Thapaliya 2.5% of the token's total supply, worth more than $50 million at recent prices. Movement Labs told CoinDesk the signed agreements with Thapaliya were not binding, but Thapaliya claimed the agreements \"were never voided.\" While framed as memoranda of understanding — normally considered non-binding — the agreements examined by CoinDesk also include provisions stating \"both parties\" must consent to their termination. \"I plan on pursuing legally to exercise my claim to retrieve 2.5% of tokens,\" Thapaliya said. Employees at Movement referred to Thapaliya as a “shadow co-founder” and said he was often consulted by Scanlon and Manche for major decisions. His name also surfaced in internal communications regarding Movement’s deal with Web3Port. The Chinese market maker was later blamed for dumping $38 million in tokens after MOVE’s debut — an event that triggered a sell-off and Binance account bans. The amount loaned to Web3Port, 5% of MOVE's supply, was identical to the amount loaned to Thapaliya per the agreement. When contacted by CoinDesk in advance of the initial investigation, Thapaliya denied having any financial interest in Movement Labs or the Movement Foundation. He also denied involvement in the Web3Port deal. In later messages on Signal, Thapaliya told CoinDesk that his work with Movement was consistent with their agreement: “As per the contract signed in February 2023, I fulfilled the agreed terms by supporting Cooper [Scanlon] in exchange-related discussions, strategizing token allocation, assisting with market maker selection, and helping hire the team that audited his airdrop model.” The use of informal agreements to quietly allocate tokens to insiders reflects a broader pattern within the crypto industry, where large sums can change hands without appearing in official fundraising disclosures. In 2024, CoinDesk reported that Eclipse — another project linked to Thapaliya — secretly allocated 5% of its token supply to an employee at Polychain, a major crypto venture firm that later invested in the project. Polychain is also an investor in Movement Labs. Eclipse's deal with the Polychain employee was scrapped following the publication of CoinDesk's investigation. What these cases illustrate is not necessarily fraud, but the ease with which crypto startups can make significant financial commitments behind closed doors — commitments that can later shape the trajectory of an entire token ecosystem, often without the community or even some employees ever knowing. One person familiar with the matter said Movement's agreements were tailored to explicitly avoid disclosures to investors or community members. In another 2023 agreement obtained by CoinDesk, Movement Labs agrees to give an entity linked to Vinit Parekh, \"Digital Incubation Group,\" $50,000 annually for every $1 million raised by Movement Labs — a sum that would total approximately $2 million per year, based on Movement’s $38 million in funding. Another agreement granted a separate Parekh entity control of 2.5% of the MOVE token supply. In exchange for his allocation, Parekh’s firm, Digital Incubation Group, was tasked with a broad mandate, including: “development of strategy framework, validated by relevant stakeholders; consultation through the pre-seed raise process (including advice and connection to investors), close seed raise; development of tokenomics and release plan; engage in structuring team pre-product launch.” Like Thapaliya’s agreements, Parekh's were structured as memoranda of understanding with a termination clause requiring consent from both \"parties.\" Parekh and Movement Labs both said the agreements were exploratory and that funds never changed hands between either party. Two people close to Movement Labs said that Parekh, a Microsoft product manager-turned blockchain industry consultant, was nonetheless a frequent presence at Movement's San Francisco office and played a role in the company's hiring, marketing, and strategy decisions. \"I just care about the ecosystem,\" Parekh told CoinDesk in an interview. \"No money was given to me or to anyone I know,\" in connection to the agreements, \"[b]ut I did help them on the marketing strategy and understanding how to do go-to-market.\" The fallout from Movement’s market-making scandal has exposed a widening rift between its co-founders, Manche and Scanlon. After an excerpt from one of the Thapaliya agreements leaked on X, Manche pointed to Scanlon’s signature on the memo, highlighting his former partner’s role in approving the deal. He also reposted a message questioning whether Movement Labs was “throwing [Manche] under the bus” while Scanlon “played innocent.” Manche was ousted from Movement Labs earlier this month, shortly after CoinDesk reported he had helped coordinate the project’s controversial market-making agreement with Web3Port and an intermediary known as Rentech — a third party that Movement later claimed misrepresented itself in the deal. CoinDesk has since learned that Manche also played a role in facilitating a separate arrangement between Web3Port and Kaito, another crypto project that shares the same director and general counsel as Movement Foundation. A contract reviewed by CoinDesk shows that OpenKaito Foundation loaned 2.5% of its KAITO token supply to \"Whisper,\" an entity linked to Web3Port. The agreement — which was also leaked on X by an anonymous account — was terminated shortly after it was signed, according to an X post from Kaito founder Yu Hu. Unlike the Movement deal, it did not include terms that experts said incentivized pump-and-dump behavior. A person familiar with the matter said Manche introduced Kaito to Rentech, which then connected the project to Web3Port. The controversy has already dented Movement’s reputation in an industry that once saw the startup as a rising star. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, announced it would suspend trading of the MOVE token on May 15. The token’s price fell by 50% in the following week. On May 7, Movement Labs said it would spin out a new entity, Move Industries, to serve as the network’s primary developer. Scanlon remains with the organization but has stepped down as CEO.

        "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Imagine two major newspapers both endorsing the same presidential candidate. The joint support indicates that the candidate probably has a broad backing. Similarly, when price charts for both bitcoin BTC$103,245.93 and Strategy (MSTR) — the largest publicly-listed BTC holder — show concurrent bullish signals, it’s likely a strong sign that the market and major institutional players are aligned. Daily price charts for both BTC and MSTR show their 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) crossing above their 100-day SMA to confirm a so-called bullish crossover. It's a sign the short-term trend is now outperforming the longer-term trend, which could be a signal of the beginning of a major bull market. BTC's bull cross is consistent with other indicators like the MACD, suggesting the path of least resistance is on the higher side. That said, an interim drop below $100,000 cannot be ruled out, as on-chain data show influential market participants have turned cautious. The chart shows BTC's price rally has stalled in the $101,000-$107,000 range. A downside break could trigger more profit-taking, potentially deepening the bull market pullback to support at $98,000.  Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.  Omkar previously worked at FXStreet, writing research on currency markets and as fundamental analyst at currency and commodities desk at Mumbai-based brokerage houses. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot. About Contact",

The integration means that users of “every crypto wallet” will be able to access virtual Mastercards that draw directly from their stablecoin balances. The cards can be used at any merchant in Mastercard’s network. The rollout comes amid a broader trend. Mastercard has last month unveiled end-to-end stablecoin capabilities as it moves deeper into the cryptocurrency economy, and partnered with OKX to launch a debit card with the exchange. Similarly, crypto exchange Kraken teamed up with Mastercard to let its users in the UK and Europe spend their cryptocurrency at any merchant in the payments giant’s network. Earlier this year, Mastercard also began supporting tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on its network through a partnership with Ondo Finance, which offers tokenized U.S. Treasury bills.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 13:00:00 +0000",
        "content": "Venture capital firm a16z Crypto has led a $7 million seed round for KYD Labs, a blockchain-based ticketing platform aimed at giving artists and venues control over ticket sales, fan data, and revenue.  The investment comes as KYD looks to expand its presence in the live event space, already showing success at iconic venues like New York’s Le Poisson Rouge (LPR), the firm said in a press release. Founded by Ahmed Nimale, a former product manager at Ticketmaster, and David Barrick, creator of the ad-tech platform Flipmass, KYD Labs is looking to address long-standing issues in ticketing: lost revenues by artists and venues. Typically, artists and venues lose out on revenue as secondary sales and ticket platforms control customer data. KYD aims to change that by offering venues direct access to fan insights and revenue streams. \"We built KYD, which stands for 'Keep Your Distribution,' to make sure no artist or venue ever has to ask again for something that is rightfully theirs,\" said Nimale, who is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  KYD's platform, built on Solana, offers a streamlined ticket-buying experience. Fans can purchase tickets in under 30 seconds with just a phone number, bypassing crypto wallet complexities.  Venues see increased engagement and revenue—LPR reported a 30% rise in ticket sales and millions in additional income since adopting KYD’s system. \"Since adopting KYD’s tools, we’ve been able to double our return on investment and significantly improve overall efficiency,\" said Shannon Wiles, Marketing Director at LPR. The platform also plans to roll out two new protocol layers: the $KYD token to provide capital for venues and tours, and the $TIX reward token to incentivize fan loyalty, functioning similarly to airline miles. These features are designed to strengthen financial stability for artists and venues while fostering community engagement. KYD has processed $4 million in ticket sales and earned over $1 million in revenue within the past year. It plans to expand to more than 100 U.S. venues by 2026 and eventually aims to power live event commerce at major arenas worldwide. By leveraging blockchain for ticketing, KYD Labs is positioning itself as a modern alternative to traditional ticketing giants, promising greater autonomy for creators and a smoother experience for fans.

        "content": "Bitlayer, a bitcoin Layer 2 based on the BitVM paradigm, and Sui blockchain have teamed up to make bitcoin (BTC) more useful in the Sui ecosystem. The collaboration involves Sui integrating Bitlayer’s BitVM bridge to launch Peg-BTC (YBTC), a Bitcoin-backed token, on its platform, according to an exclusive announcement shared with CoinDesk. It allows bitcoin holders to transfer their BTC into Sui via the BitVM bridge. The bridged version, Peg-BTC, can then be used within Sui’s DeFi ecosystem to earn additional yields. \"Bitcoin’s dominance as a store of value is unmatched, but its utility in DeFi remains untapped. By integrating Bitcoin’s liquidity into Sui’s ecosystem, Peg-BTC (YBTC) empowers users to earn yield while maintaining direct exposure to BTC’s value—a paradigm shift for BTCFi,” Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer, said in a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk. BitcoinFi, or allowing BTC users to earn additional yields through DeFi, was one of the hottest topics at the Token2049 conference in Dubai. Franklin Templeton backed the idea at the event, saying it will boost BTC's appeal beyond the long-prevalent store of value story. Bitlayer is the Bitcoin-security equivalent Layer 2 built on the BitVM paradigm to bring smart contract capabilities to bitcoin without influencing its core consensus. It relies on off-chain computation and on-chain fraud proofs to keep the network secure and decentralized. Bitlayer's BitVM-powered zk bridge is a special tool that facilitates safe and secure movement of BTC onto different blockchain ecosystems without relying on centralized intermediaries or middlemen. It’s trust-minimized, meaning it’s designed to be very secure and decentralized. Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain focusing on offering high-speed and low-cost transactions through parallel processing. As of writing, its DeFi ecosystem comprised 49 projects, boasting over $2 billion in crypto deposits, per data source DeFiLlama. Integrating Peg-BTC (YBTC) into the Sui ecosystem opens up several new opportunities for users, like staking Peg-BTC to earn interest through various Bitcoin staking protocols. Users can also lend or borrow Peg-BTC by lending it out to earn yields or using it as collateral for loans. Additionally, Peg-BTC can be traded on popular decentralized exchanges within Sui, allowing users to swap and provide liquidity to earn trading fees. Hu said they plan to work with Sui's top protocols, with the biggest traction in terms of total value locked, fully diluted value and user base within the Sui ecosystem. Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO at Mysten Labs, the company behind Sui, said they are taking a holistic approach while catering to the growing demand for BitcoinFi. \"Sui is taking a holistic approach by onboarding a full stack of infrastructure and BTCfi asset options into the ecosystem, including staking, restaking, bridge integrations, WBTC, sBTC, and soon Peg-BTC (YBTC). Demand is growing for Bitcoin to serve a greater purpose beyond simply being held,\" Abiodun told CoinDesk. \"Key integrations, such as the BitVM bridge with Bitlayer, are transforming the experience for Bitcoin holders by enabling them to earn, engage with DeFi, and put their assets to work on Sui,\" Abiodun added. As of today, BTC assets comprise over 10% of the total TVL locked in the Sui ecosystem, with over 587 BTC flowing into DeFi since February. \"With support for leading BTCfi integrations, Sui’s advanced programmability activates Bitcoin’s utility, enabling users to move beyond holding and into a secure, high-performance chain,\" Abiodun noted.

        "content": "Tokyo-listed investment firm Metaplanet (3350) generated 592 million yen ($4 million) in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025, largely through bitcoin-based income strategies. The company reported 877 million yen in revenue, with 88% coming from option premium harvesting on bitcoin BTC$103,251.06, according to its first quarter earnings release. Metaplanet’s bitcoin stash grew by more than 5,000 BTC in the quarter to reach 6,796 BTC. The firm has achieved 68% of its 10,000 BTC target just over four months after adopting its bitcoin standard on April 8, 2024, according to the document. This aggressive accumulation has helped it become the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and the top in Asia. The company recently overtook El Salvador in the metric. To finance its BTC accumulation, Metaplanet sold bonds, issued equity, and sold moving-strike stock warrants that only activate when share prices rise. The company raised 86.1 billion yen through this mechanism, becoming the largest public equity issuer in Japan so far this year. Metaplanet’s capital strategy hinges on leveraging operating cash flow and market-raised funds into bitcoin, boosting its BTC Yield, a metric tracking bitcoin per fully diluted share. That figure jumped 170% year-to-date. Metaplanet’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange went down 2.47% in the last trading session to 593 yen each. The firm’s shares are up 65.8% year-to-date, while BTC is up 8.45% over the same period. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 12:25:29 +0000",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) rally has paused above $100K, slowing the recovery rallies in major altcoins. But one coin stands resilient: monero (XMR), the world's largest privacy-focused digital asset by market value. XMR has risen 4.6% this week to $347, with prices gaining 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency has outshone every other top 100 token by market value in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the market leader, has dropped 1.6% in the past 24 hours, taking the weekly decline to 2%. Monero’s performance is even more impressive, considering its 110% recovery from the low of $165, hit during the early April sell-off when bitcoin dropped to $75,000. XMR's price charts had signaled the meteoric rise with a bullish golden cross a month ago. The rally can be attributed to several factors, including a favorable regulatory outlook, according to HTX. \"In the U.S., the regulatory outlook has shifted as the FIT21 crypto legislation advances and the SEC shows increasing ambiguity in classifying certain tokens, easing market concerns over privacy coin regulation and prompting cautious capital inflows,\" analysts at HTX Research told CoinDesk. The impending Full-Chain Membership Proofs(FCMP++) upgrade, a new and more powerful privacy feature integration, due later this year, may also be galvanizing investor interest. \"FCMP++ enhances Monero’s quantum resistance by providing forward secrecy, ensuring that a quantum adversary cannot break the privacy of past transactions even if they solve the ECDLP. By replacing ring signatures with full chain membership proofs, it eliminates vulnerabilities that quantum computers could exploit to deanonymize transactions,\" Monero society member @DatCryptoPiggie said on X. Here is an analogy to help one understand the above. Imagine having a personal diary with a lock, but there's a risk of someone developing a super-smart device to crack the lock. FCMP++ is likely an added layer of smart lock that will protect currency entries while ensuring that a potential entity managing to bypass the security tricks can't see past entries. HTX also pointed to rumors of major exchanges looking to list XMR as a source of bullish pressure for the cryptocurrency. \"Rumors that major exchanges are considering relisting some privacy coins have further boosted sentiment,\" HTX analysts said. \"Given their lower liquidity and concentrated holdings, privacy coins exhibit higher price elasticity than major cryptocurrencies, often resulting in more extreme price movements when capital enters the market.\" Lastly, some observers have suggested that the recent suspected BTC theft of $330 million may have been laundered through XMR, leading to a bullish price action.

        "content": "Solana (SOL) is starting to see capital flow back in after several weeks of outflows. Glassnode data shows SOL's 30-day realized cap inflows are now firmly back in positive territory, growing at a pace of 4–5%, a level that puts it on par with XRP. While the inflows are relatively modest compared to frenzied periods in December and January, the move marks a trend reversal following a prolonged stretch of realized losses and capital outflows that reflected investor exit and fading conviction. Realized cap inflow is a metric used to gauge actual capital entering or exiting an asset, based on the USD value of coins as they last moved on-chain. It filters out noise from speculative price spikes and instead tracks where holders are actually deploying capital. For Solana, that number turning green again could indicate that buy-side pressure is finally returning, even if price action hasn’t fully reflected it. Inflows into realized cap often serve as a leading indicator, suggesting some traders are positioning ahead of a potential bounce, or at the very least, a sign that capitulation has run its course.

[The stablecoin legislation] is going to answer a lot of those questions.\" Both executives said they expect a wave of new issuers to enter the market once regulation is in place, followed by a period of consolidation. “It’s not going to be 300 stablecoins, and it’s not going to be just two,” Fernandez da Ponte said. Currently, Tether's USDT USDT$1.00 and Circle's USDC USDC$0.99987 dominate the market, representing nearly 90% of the $230 billion asset class. PayPal’s PYUSD PYUSD$0.99955, launched in 2023, lags far behind with $900 million supply. Fernandez da Ponte pushed back on market cap as the primary metric for success. \"We look at velocity, active wallets, number of transactions,” he said. “Those are what drive real usage.\" In countries with high inflation and volatile currencies, consumers are seeking out dollar-backed stablecoins as stores of value and tools for cross-border payments. Soohoo said MoneyGram, which operates in over 200 countries with nearly half a million cash-access locations, is helping facilitate that access. \"We see ourselves between physical finance and digital finance,\" Soohoo said. \"A lot of consumers in local economies want to hold value in dollars but still need to access it as cash to spend in places that don’t take digital currency.\" Stablecoin adoption in developed countries, meanwhile, has been slower. With clear regulation in place, stablecoins can streamline corporate treasury operations and cross-border disbursement, Fernandez da Ponte noted. \"We used to have this mad rush on Friday to make sure money was in the right places before the weekend,\" he said. \"Now we’re sending money to the Philippines and Africa in ten minutes with stablecoins.\" Both executives noted that real-world use cases, not hype, will determine if stablecoins could reach the trillion-dollar scale in the next years that's been projected. \"Consumers don’t care about stablecoins. They care about solving problems.\" Fernandez da Ponte said. \"We’re five years into a ten-year journey, and regulation will define the next half.\" Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

At a panel at Consensus 2025, Ari Redbord discussed how easy it is for hacks to happen on crypto exchanges, as the industry is “the perfect storm of weak cyber controls and ultimately it's a good target.” Coinbase shared earlier on Thursday that some of its staff had been bribed to steal their customers' data, and its founder Brian Armstrong had received a ransome note for $20 million dollars in bitcoin. The team shared in a blog post that because of the breach, it could pay up to $400 million in remediation costs to affected customers, and that they were setting up a $20 million bounty on any information related to the attackers instead. The news comes as the industry has experienced other major hacks, like Bybit which was hacked earlier this year for $1.5 billion, and defunct crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 for $400 million. Though these episodes seem to happen frequently, Redbord believes more regulatory involvement can alleviate some of these issues. “There's a lot we can do with governments in order to go after these bad actors that have nothing to do with crypto or blockchain intelligence,” he said. “We have cyber facilities.” Read more: Coinbase Could Pay Customers Up to $400M for Data Breach Margaux Nijkerk reports on the Ethereum protocol and L2s.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 18:52:54 +0000",
        "content": "The latest draft of the U.S. Senate's stablecoin legislation includes enough changes that Democratic senators may now have an easier time getting back on board, though consumer advocates say it still falls short. The bill to set oversight and standards for stablecoin issuers sailed through the Senate Banking Committee with wide bipartisan support in March, but it hit a wall on the Senate floor last week as many Democrats raised objections. Chief among them were the conflicts that may be presented by President Donald Trump's own crypto interests and the possibility that big technology firms like Meta and social-media site X may be able to issue such tokens.  \"As the result of hard-fought negotiations, Democrats won major victories on a range of critical issues,\" proponents noted in a summary circulated with the draft bill. The question remaining is: Will it be enough to get back to a so-called cloture vote that will advance the bill to a floor debate that would mark its final major stage before the Senate takes a vote. The next procedural move on the Senate floor could come by next week, according to people familiar with the talks. The latest changes to the bill represent a mixed bag. The loudest requests from critics, that the president be explicitly stopped from personally benefiting from the crypto industry that his administration will regulate, were not directly addressed in this version of the bill. But on the concerns over tech giants sprouting with a field of new dollar-based tokens, the bill dealt with it in part: \"A public company that is not predominantly engaged in one or more financial activities, and its wholly or majority owned subsidiaries or affiliates, may not issue a payment stablecoin unless the public company obtains a unanimous vote of the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee,\" according to the latest draft. The committee would be a multi-agency group created under the legislation to look at such requests. There are major loopholes in that, according to Mark Hays, who focuses on crypto and financial-technology issues for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. For starters, he said, it affects only public companies and not private ones, such as X and TiKTok. \"There's already a way that large tech firms that aren't public could become issuers without adhering to these new standards,\" he said. Also, he added, \"it's quite possible under this bill that a public company could secure an interest in a non-public company, and that's another way around it.\" He argued that this overall draft gave toothless answers to the concern of consumer advocates. \"Pushing this through on an arbitrary deadline because the crypto industry is breathing down your neck is not a good way to make policy,\" Hays said. \"And it's especially bad when that policy could further enable and enrich the president.\" Bo Hines, one of Trump's chief advisers on crypto, appeared at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Wednesday to insist that there's no conflict in the president's business interests or his family's involvement in the industry, including its stake in World Liberty Financial. He said that Trump \"can't be bought.\" The White House's Hines, who acts as a liaison to Capitol Hill during the legislative negotiations, expressed continued confidence about the effort staying on track in the Senate. \"Negotiations are ongoing,\" Hines said at Consensus. \"But I remain steadfast in my optimism that we're going to achieve — the president's desire is to do it — both stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.\" Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

        "content": "The SEC has been investigating crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) over whether it misstated its user numbers in past securities filings and marketing materials.  The probe began under the former presidential administration while the SEC was still under the control of then-Chair Gary Gensler, according to the NYT, which first reported the story, but has persisted under the SEC’s current, crypto-friendly leadership. The metric at the heart of the investigation is Coinbase’s claim to have over 100 million “verified users.” It stopped using the metric in both disclosure and marketing materials in 2021, the year it went public on the Nasdaq. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement that the SEC’s investigation is a “hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public.” “We explained that the verified users metric includes anyone who verified their email address or phone number with us, so it may overstate the number of unique customers,\" said Grewal \"We also disclosed – and continue to disclose – the more relevant metric of ‘monthly transacting users’ – the number of people who use our platform in a given month.\" “While we strongly believe this investigation should not continue, we remain committed to working with the SEC to bring this matter to a close,” Grewal added. The SEC did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time. Already under pressure due to today's disclosure of a data breach, COIN shares dipped a bit further on this SEC news, now down 6.6% on the session.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 17:44:16 +0000",
        "content": "TORONTO —Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, said he believes bitcoin is digital gold and called the largest digital currency a store of value, during a packed panel at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  \"I really believe in digital gold, which is bitcoin, right? I believe in the store of value,\" Trump said. However, Eric Trump — who has a background in real estate — told the crowd at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto that he didn't get into bitcoin or crypto until politics intertwined the Trump family and the crypto community. \"It wasn't until the very same group that was attacking my family for no reason whatsoever other than political beliefs, started attacking [the] crypto community that it really drove two people who might not have always been like-minded together and that partnership has been absolutely amazing,\" he said Thursday. Aside from politics, he also realized real estate is not as liquid as bitcoin, which has better liquidity and was easier to transact, solidifying his belief in the digital currency. \"I also realized, kind of, through some of that political weaponization, you know, some of the limitations of real estate. Real estate has created tremendous wealth for our family. At the same time, real estate can't be transferred. It's very hard to sell,\" he said. \"I sold a hotel two years ago. It took me a year and a half to literally transact that hotel because you have title reports and you have managers that have to go in, and you have best proliferations. You do all sorts of things,\" Trump said. \"... You constantly have to manage it. You constantly have to watch operations, right? And then all of a sudden, you've got this kind of digital asset which you don't need to watch, you don't need to manage. You know, it's easy to transact on.\" Trump is the co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining firm founded in partnership with Hut 8 and slated to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). The Gryphon partnership came about from a desire to take the American Bitcoin partnership public as quickly as possible, said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot on stage alongside Trump to a standing-room only crowd. An existing mining business was a key part of that plan as well as getting 'American' and 'bitcoin' as part of the company name.  \"American Bitcoin, to me, is everything, you know. And I we came up with the name, I said one thing. I said, Listen, it has to have the word American, and it has to have the word Bitcoin in it,\" Trump said.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant fluctuations as global economic factors and regulatory developments create both challenges and opportunities. Litecoin's recent price action reflects this broader market sentiment, with the cryptocurrency encountering strong resistance at $101.65 after reaching a peak of $101.90. Despite the subsequent correction to the $95-$96 range, LTC has shown resilience with support emerging around $95.82.  Market analysts point to the recent US-China tariff agreement as a key driver behind Litecoin's price movements, with the cryptocurrency gaining bullish momentum following the deal announcement. Additionally, Federal Reserve policy decisions have contributed to positive sentiment in risk assets, helping LTC maintain its position above critical support levels despite the correction.  In the regulatory landscape, the SEC has delayed decisions on spot ETF applications for several cryptocurrencies including Litecoin, creating uncertainty but also anticipation. Despite these delays, betting markets show ~80% probability for approval before year-end, suggesting continued optimism among investors. This regulatory environment, combined with increasing institutional adoption and cross-border transaction utility, positions Litecoin as a significant player in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio shared Thursday that he thinks the blockchain wasn’t necessarily meant to be a “competitor to Bitcoin,” but rather “it was meant to be an alternative.” Speaking to a crowd at Consensus 2025, Di Iorio shared with the audience about his time during Ethereum’s early days, noting back then that he understood that the project could become a really big movement. “We could sense and feel that it was picking up,” Di Iorio said. Di Iorio was one of the eight co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, but originally got into cryptocurrency through his advocacy with Bitcoin. He started Bitcoin meetups in Toronto in 2012, and through that met Vitalik Buterin, who came up with the Ethereum whitepaper and shared it with his fellow co-founders. While Di Iorio is still a big Bitcoin proponent, he has said that “I do think eventually Ethereum has a possibility of overtaking it in terms of market capitalization.” “With the amount of use cases, and the value that Ethereum is allowing to be created, I think it has that opportunity, in order to possibly overtake it,” Di Iorio added. After stepping away from the Ethereum Foundation, Anthony Di Iorio founded Decentral in 2014, which is best known for creating the Jaxx Liberty crypto wallet. In 2022, he launched Andiami, a project blending hardware, tokenomics, and game theory to tackle centralization vectors within decentralized networks.

        "content": "Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Leary Ventures, said the crypto industry isn’t regulated enough — which is holding digital assets back from true institutional adoption. Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Thursday, O’Leary said crypto assets under management (AUM) have hit a wall, which he attributed to a lack of regulatory clarity that has prevented the majority of sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and institutional investors from investing meaningfully. “I never thought I’d say this, but I want more regulation and I want it now,” O’Leary said. “The good news is there’s a new sheriff in town: Paul Atkins at the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission].” O’Leary said Atkins, who was sworn in as chairman of the SEC last month, has already telegraphed that he’s friendly to the crypto industry and will “regulate accordingly.” Atkins replaces Gary Gensler, whose penchant for so-called “regulation by enforcement” drew the ire of many in the crypto industry. O’Leary said Thursday that he respected Gensler’s consistency as a regulator. “He said he was gonna sue you, and he sued you,” O’Leary said. “He was consistent and you have to respect that.” In a press conference ahead of his keynote speech, O’Leary said he'd received a Wells notice from the SEC over a decade ago after speaking about debt tokenization in a televised interview. He was cleared, he said, but the experience temporarily scared him off engaging with crypto in the U.S. “My first experience with crypto was over a decade ago, when I was on business cable, talking about debt tokenization,” O’Leary said. “I get a knock on my door and it’s an enforcement agent from the SEC serving me a Wells notice. I shit my pants … The regulator was sending a message. I got the message” Since Gensler departed the agency in January, the SEC has done an about-face on its approach to crypto regulation, creating a Crypto Task Force spearheaded by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce and dropping a host of open investigations and lawsuits against crypto companies that were started under Gensler. A friendlier SEC isn’t the only thing O’Leary is hopeful for when it comes to crypto regulation — he expects to see the passage of the GENIUS Act within “months.” “The minute that happens, it will signal the move to the next act, the market infrastructure act,” O’Leary said. “And when that is determined and regulated, Katy, bar the doors — a trillion dollars will come in and index [bitcoin].” On the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime. Cheyenne is originally from Houston, Texas. She studied political science at Tulane University in Louisiana. In December 2021, she graduated from CUNY's Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, where she focused on business and economics reporting. She has no significant crypto holdings.

        "content": "The daughter and grandson of a French crypto exchange CEO were targeted in a failed kidnap attempt, adding to the growing number of crypto-related kidnapping cases in the country, France 24 reported on Tuesday. A video widely shared on social media showed the attempt, in which three masked men wrestled the woman and another person to the ground in Paris. A shop owner intervened, waving a fire extinguisher, and the attackers gave up, driving off in two waiting vans. France 24 identified the crypto exchange as Paymium. The attack follows earlier — successful — kidnappings in the country. In January, David Ballard, a co-founder of crypto-wallet developer Ledger, was ransomed after being kidnapped with his wife from their home. In May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was kidnapped and rescued days later. Four suspects were arrested at the time, the BBC reported. Both of the men had a finger chopped off. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Wednesday he plans to meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to discuss how to protect them following the surge of kidnappers targeting wealthy people with crypto ties in France. The Paris prosecutors office opened an investigation into the attack, Reuters reported. \"These units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,\" Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin said at Consensus on Wednesday in response to a question on the worldwide kidnapping for ransom trend. \"I think that the message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable.\" Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

After establishing resistance at $6.780, UNI cascaded downward with multiple high-volume selling periods, breaking below critical support levels, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. This volatility comes as blockchain data reveals large institutional holders transferred substantial UNI positions to centralized exchanges, with two addresses moving 11.65 million tokens ($82.38M) to Coinbase Prime.Technical Analysis Highlights Disclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

        "content": "After a suddenly rocky road for the U.S. legislative effort to regulate stablecoin issuers, the Senate is poised to move forward again with newly polished language in the bill that may see some procedural movement as soon as Thursday. The Senate's stablecoin push veered off course a week ago when Democrats objected, primarily to President Donald Trump's personal crypto business interests, but the lawmakers continued negotiations and are said to be close to an agreement on updated text to the \"Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins\" (GENIUS) Act, according to people familiar with the talks. The bill would establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of another asset, such as Tether's USDT$1.00 and Circle's USDC$0.99987, and there's a similar one grinding its way through the House of Representatives. A previous version of the bill advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support earlier this year, giving the crypto sector confidence that it would probably meet with little resistance on the Senate floor. However, the text was updated and the Senate failed to advance the bill into its final stage, a process known as cloture in which 60 senators need to agree to move legislation to an open floor debate. Every Democrat and two Republicans voted against it (a third Republican, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, originally supported the cloture motion but flipped his vote at the last minute in a procedural move to keep the legislation alive). That left the stablecoin bill in legislative limbo, but people familiar with the negotiation told CoinDesk that it may soon be back on track. The next vote would likely be a procedural action to buy lawmakers more time to negotiate specifics of the bill than a cloture motion, two of the people said. One of the central points of contention for Democrats was President Trump's increasing forays into crypto, particularly after Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX announced it would close its purchase of a stake in global exchange Binance using USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, which in turn is linked to Trump and his children. However, the bill's text, which hasn't yet been released publicly, is unlikely to include any provisions addressing this potential conflict of interest. Senator Gillibrand, the New York Democrat who has been working on crypto legislation for years, suggested at a Stand With Crypto event on Wednesday that the latest version still doesn't focus directly on Trump. \"This bill does have some ethics requirements that I think are really strong and very good, but it's not an ethics bill per se, and if we were dealing with all President Trump's ethics problems, it would be a very long and detailed bill,\" she said.  She said she's \"very optimistic we will have a vote soon enough.\" At the same event, Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Republican chair of a digital assets subcommittee in the Senate and a frequent partner to Gillibrand on crypto regulation, argued against lawmakers being distracted by the \"shiny object that's out in the corner.\" \"I don't want the fact that President Trump's name comes up in relation to this to distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry that is being used to provide a new market for US Treasuries that helps the dollar stay the world reserve currency,\" Lummis said. Bo Hines, Trump's executive director for the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto on Wednesday that \"negotiations are ongoing\" when asked about a possible vote on Thursday. He indicated that he thinks the legislation will keep moving. \"We shall see,\" he said.

        "content": "Berachain is focused on building “decorrelated populations” of users to guard against market reflexivity, said Smokey the Bera, theblockchain’s pseudonymous founder, onstage at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2025 event in Toronto. Reflexivity is a big concern in decentralised finance and crypto. It refers to the self-reinforcing effect of market sentiment. Rising prices often attract buyers and create a positive feedback loop. However, the same process can operate in reverse leading to a catastrophic collapse in prices. Berachain’s plan for the second and third quarters is to support profitable businesses that exist in web2 and are uncorrelated to the existing DeFi and crypto markets. Doing so will help Berachain guard against reflexivity, helping it weather market volatility and retain deep liquidity, Smokey said. Smokey was joined by Jason Atkins from market making firm Auros, when they discussed all things to do with liquidity — essentially how easily and quickly a crypto asset can be bought or sold without a significant impact on its price. Tim reports on all things DeFi. He came to CoinDesk from DL News where he published over 400 articles covering everything from institutional adoption to DAO governance. He reported extensively on North Korea’s $1.4 billion theft from crypto exchange Bybit and documented its impact across the crypto industry. He also conducted multiple investigations into alleged crypto scams, and his reporting on Waves was cited in a lawsuit filed by the FTX Recovery Trust against the blockchain’s founder Sasha Ivanov. His previous reporting on the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was also cited in documents submitted to the High Court of Singapore.

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:00:00 +0000",
        "content": "0x, a decentralized exchange infrastructure firm, announced the acquisition of rival Flood, a move the firm says will help it compete in the hyper competitive aggregation market. Decentralized exchanges — or DEXs — are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. They let blockchain users swap between assets without the need for an intermediary or middleman such as a centralized exchange. Aggregators like 0x’s act as a one-stop-shop for traders, searching all the DEXs out there to find the one that offers the most cost-efficient trades, for a small fee. Competition is fierce and often exists on razor-thin margins. It was Flood’s proprietary aggregation software that motivated the acquisition, Amir Bandeali, CEO of 0x, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. 0x uses its own trade simulation technology to check how well its aggregation software works compared with its competitors, Bandeali said. “We were able to take a look at Flood as well and run similar types of tests and we were very impressed with the data that we saw.” “Everything got made from scratch,” Francesco Baccetti, co-founder and CEO of Flood, told CoinDesk. “We rewrote the whole stack to get this level of performance that we now have.” The acquisition is 0x’s first since the firm’s founding in 2017. A spokesperson for 0x declined to share how much it paid for Flood, citing contractual obligations. Flood raised $5.2 million from investors in a February 2024 seed funding round. DEX aggregators are a big business. Over the past week, the top 12 aggregators facilitated almost $10 billion worth of swap volume, around 10% of all on-chain trading, according to data compiled by Fredrik Haga, co-founder of Dune Analytics. Aggregators with tradable tokens are valued at a combined $2.3 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 0x is one of the oldest DEX aggregators. But it’s not the largest. On Ethereum and other compatible blockchains, 1inch and CoW Swap consistently handle the most trading volume among aggregators, while on Solana, Jupiter dominates. Bandeali said he’s hopeful that by combining the two companies' technologies, 0x will be able to win market share from larger aggregators on both Ethereum and Solana. Another motivation for the acquisition was Flood’s team of developers. “This is a pretty niche domain,” Bandeali said, explaining that it's very difficult for his firm to find talented developers who specialize in aggregation and trade routing. Having the right developers therefore is crucial to an aggregator’s continued success. “It sounds simple but it’s really complicated,” he said. “It gets more complicated as new chains and new tokens launch.” The reward for proving the best swaps is great. CoW Swap is set to bring in almost $11 million in revenue this year, according to DefiLlama data. (It’s unclear how much revenue 1inch makes, while Jupiter’s projected $162 million in revenue comes from more than just its aggregation services). 0x has also expanded into other areas, such as providing APIs that integrate its aggregator into other products, and trading analytics. But improving its core aggregation product, which powers swaps in apps like Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood, Phantom and Farcaster, is still the main focus. And with DeFi getting more complex by the day, the demand for aggregators is likely to keep increasing. “We’re just trying to abstract away the complexity faster than it’s created for our customers,” Bandeali said.

Learn more. – Sarah Morton When major financial institutions — from Citi and Standard Chartered to Brevan Howard, McKinsey and BCG — rally around a once-niche innovation, it’s a good idea to take note, especially when the innovation is stablecoins, a tokenized representation of money on-chain. What email was to the internet, stablecoin is to blockchain — instant and cost-effective value transfer at a global scale running 24/7. Stablecoin is blockchain’s first killer use case. First introduced by Tether in 2015 and hailed as the first stablecoin, USDT offered early crypto users a way to hold and transfer a stable, dollar-denominated value on-chain. Until then, their only alternative was bitcoin. Tether’s dollar-backed stablecoin made its debut on Bitfinex before rapidly spreading to major exchanges like Binance and OKX. It quickly became the default trading pair across the digital asset ecosystem. As adoption grew, so did its utility. No longer just a trading tool, stablecoin emerged as the primary cash-equivalent for trading, cash management, and payments. Below is the trajectory of stablecoin’s market size since inception, a reflection of its evolution from a crypto niche to a core pillar of digital finance. The reason stablecoins have been a hot topic in finance is their rapid adoption and growth. According to Visa, stablecoin on-chain transaction volume exceeded $5.5 trillion in 2024. By comparison, Visa’s volume was $13.2 trillion while Mastercard transacted $9.7 trillion during the same period. Why such proliferation? Because stable dollar-denominated cash is the lifeblood for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here are 3 major use cases for stablecoin. 1. Digital Assets Trading Given its origins, it's no surprise that trading was stablecoin’s first major use case. What began as a niche tool for value preservation in 2015 is now the beating heart of digital asset trading. Today, stablecoins underpin over $30 trillion in annual trading volume across centralized exchanges, powering the vast majority of spot and derivatives activity. But stablecoin’s impact doesn’t end with centralized exchanges — It is also the liquidity backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Onchain traders need the same reliable cash equivalent for moving in and out of positions. A glance at leading decentralized platforms, such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Hyperliquid, shows that top trading pairs are consistently denominated by stablecoins. Monthly decentralized exchange volumes routinely hit $100-200 billion, according to The Block, further cementing stablecoin’s role as the foundational layer of the modern digital assets market. 2. Real World Assets Real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as bonds and equities. Once a fringe idea, RWAs are now among the fastest-growing asset classes in crypto. Leading this wave is the tokenized U.S. Treasury market, now boasting over $6 billion AUM. Launched in early 2023, these on-chain Treasuries opened the door for crypto-native capital to access the low-risk, short-duration US T-Bills yield. The adoption saw a staggering 6,000% growth according to RWA.xyz: from just $100 million in early 2023 to over $6 billion AUM today. Asset management heavyweights such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity (pending SEC approval) are all creating on-chain treasury products for digital capital markets. Unlike traditional Treasuries, these digital versions offer 24/7 instant mint/redemptions, and seamless composability with other DeFi yield opportunities. Investors can subscribe and redeem around the clock, with stablecoin liquidity delivered in real time. Circle’s facility with BlackRock’s BUIDL and PayPal’s integration with Ondo’s OUSG are just two prominent examples. 3. Payment A major emerging use case for stablecoins is cross-border payment, especially in corridors underserved by traditional financial infrastructure. In much of the world, international payments remain slow, expensive, and error-prone due to dependency on correspondent banking. By contrast, stablecoins offer merchants and consumers an alternative with its instant, low-cost, always-on transfers. According to research from a16z, stablecoin payments are 99.99% cheaper and 99.99% faster than traditional wire transfers and they settle 24/7. The shift is gaining momentum in the West, too. Stripe’s $1 billion acquisition of Bridge and subsequent introduction of Stablecoin Financial Account signal the start of mainstream global adoption. Meanwhile, PayPal’s rollout of yield on PYUSD balances highlights stablecoin’s rise as a legitimate retail payment vertical. What was once a crypto-native solution is fast becoming a global financial utility. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q. In light of the recent news from Europe regarding stablecoins and Tether, can you explain how stablecoin investment is valuable to an individual? A. In the inherently volatile and highly risky world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide individuals with a capital-efficient way to gain exposure to digital assets. Pegged to fiat currencies like the euro or commodities like gold, these digital assets provide stability and a hedge against crypto’s volatility. Crypto individuals can park their funds safely in stablecoins during times of uncertainty without having to exit the market and deal with TradFi. This is why stablecoins dominate crypto. Their combined market cap has surpassed $245bln, a massive 15x growth over the last five years. Q. Given current market trends in Europe, are stablecoins more or less susceptible to market fluctuations? A. While stablecoins are inherently less volatile than typical crypto assets, they remain sensitive to regulatory developments and issuer credibility. When it comes to Europe, specifically, stablecoins have become less susceptible to market fluctuations due to stringent regulatory measures. This includes the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a clear legal framework that requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and comply with strict governance standards. Such rules reduce the risk of de-pegging and enhance overall stability. However, this leads to market consolidation, a lack of competition, and reduced innovation at the same time. Q. Is Europe becoming a new stablecoin hub as it becomes more receptive to crypto? A. Europe has been signalling a friendly approach to crypto through MiCA, the first comprehensive crypto framework globally that introduces licensing requirements for digital asset service providers and AML protocols. The aim is to create a structured and harmonized regulatory environment for the crypto market, protect customers, and ensure financial stability. Through its evolving MiCA regulations, Europe could certainly enhance institutional confidence and attract more stablecoin issuers. However, that would require overcoming licensing (a lengthy and costly process) issues, effective implementation at national levels, and adapting to the fast-progressing crypto space. Europe is currently not a global leader in stablecoin adoption, but with clearer rules coming into place and its openness to compliant entities, it is well-positioned to emerge as a key hub for compliant stablecoin innovation. - Trevor Koverko, co-founder, Sapien Harvey Li writes about the business of tokenization and help teams navigate the roadblocks that stall adoption. As the founder of Tokenization Insight, the premier tokenization intelligence & GTM platform for institutions, he has a simple conviction: tokenization will transform global markets but only with the right products, distribution strategies, and communication frameworks in place. He work with leading tokenization teams to position them top-of-mind with key institutional stakeholders and support emerging startups in crafting and executing go-to-market strategies. Clients he's supported include Ondo Finance ($1B+ AUM), Ownera (interoperability partner to DTCC and JPMorgan) and Provenance Blockchain. About Contact",

        "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 14:27:20 +0000",
        "content": "TORONTO — Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, made a case for Canada's new government to create a national crypto strategy during his appearance at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  Speaking on a panel titled, \"What the new Canadian Government Needs to do to Lead In Crypto,\" Matheson outlined some key steps he believes will help position Canada as a leader in the blockchain space. Matheson highlighted that Canada has long been a hub for crypto innovation, citing Ethereum's origins and the strong presence of Web3 developers at Canadian universities.  However, he said the country risks falling behind as other nations actively shape crypto policies. \"We need leadership. We need champions in government to embrace this technology and legitimize it in the eyes of the everyday Canadian,\" Matheson said. He emphasized the importance of having a dedicated federal crypto leader, similar to the U.S. crypto czar. One of his primary suggestions was for Carney to establish a government-led crypto task force within the first 100 days of the new administration.  This task force would develop a national crypto strategy, including defining digital assets, regulating stablecoins, and allowing banks to hold crypto securely. Matheson also proposed creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and integrating crypto mining with existing data centers. Matheson noted that stablecoins could play a key role in making digital assets less speculative, suggesting that Canada needs a stable, Canadian-dollar-denominated coin to boost financial efficiency.  \"One in five Canadians remit money abroad. We pay between 6% and 12% to remit money all around the world. And today, with crypto, you can click different buttons on your phone and send your friends and family 6% to 12% more money,\" he said. Metheson also noted that 15% of Canadians are considered underbanked in Canada, which creates \"a significant opportunity for us to drive innovation and change,\" in the country via crypto.  To further advocate for policy change, Matheson pointed to the \"Stand with Crypto\" initiative.  This aims to educate lawmakers about blockchain's benefits and address misconceptions. He noted that the initiative is gaining traction among industry leaders and aims to build support among the members of Parliament. As Canada transitions to a new government led by Mark Carney, Matheson expressed optimism about the new administration's new mandates regarding innovative technology.  \"They [Liberals] are mandated to build Canada to find economic growth and opportunities for us to embrace technology. And we have a government that is highly motivated to think of opportunities to help our country gain more economic advantage. And I think crypto and other technologies will need to be embraced, and to do that, we need to educate them,\" he said.  However, Matheson cautioned that Canada risks being left behind in the global race to integrate crypto into the financial system unless it takes swift action. He compared the current challenges in Canada as \"a square peg, round hole, legal definitional problem,\" due to several different layers of securities regulators. This means that Canadians are forced to look elsewhere for crypto-related services, potentially resulting in a loss of opportunity for the country and opening users to risks. \"We're at risk for not moving fast enough to embrace the types of technology and products and services in Canada, and as a regulated financial institution, it's a priority for us to make sure that we can introduce these products and services in a compliant way, so that Canadians aren't just using a VPN and jumping off and using non compliant platforms around the world.\" Read more: Coinbase’s Lucas Matheson on Why Canada Needs a Blockchain Strategy Aoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's Head of Americas.

        "content": "Movement Labs, the scandal-plagued crypto startup backed by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial, quietly promised large stakes of its token to early insiders—undisclosed deals that now raise fresh questions about who really holds power behind the scenes. Even before its token launch, Movement Labs committed large portions of MOVE’s supply to a handful of early advisers — arrangements that were never disclosed to investors and only surfaced through internal documents reviewed by CoinDesk. Two business memos obtained by CoinDesk — one promising a single adviser nearly $2 million a year — show how Movement, founded in 2023 by two 20-year-old Vanderbilt dropouts, leaned heavily on these advisers to gain a foothold in the crypto industry. Movement Labs said the agreements, dated shortly after the project's founding, were exploratory in nature and non-binding. The existence of the agreements nonetheless casts new light on the chaotic inner workings of Movement, which came under fire after CoinDesk reported last month that insider market-making deals enabled token dumping by insiders. The fallout has sparked waves of finger-pointing inside the company, centering on who steered Movement into a predatory agreement with a Chinese market maker under terms that analysts say incentivized predatory selling. The tension has boiled over into a public rift between co-founders Rushi Manche, who was terminated by Movement Labs this month, and Cooper Scanlon, who stepped back from his CEO role but remains at the company. “When we started Movement, I was the CTO — leading the engineering team. I left most business decisions, including the contracts, to Cooper,” Manche told CoinDesk when reached for comment. “When priorities changed, our roles changed, but Cooper’s decisions in the early days heavily shaped the way the launch went.” CoinDesk spoke to more than a dozen people familiar with Movement over the course of its investigation, including current and former employees who were granted anonymity so they could speak freely. The agreements obtained by CoinDesk concern Sam Thapaliya and Vinit Parekh, both of whom played behind-the-scenes roles in shaping the project during its early stages. Together, they were allocated access to as much as 10% of the total MOVE token supply in signed memoranda of understanding that insiders say were intentionally kept off the books. Thapaliya, the CEO of Zebec Protocol and an early advisor to Manche and Scanlon, was loaned 5% of MOVE’s supply for marketing and market-making purposes, according to one of the agreements obtained by CoinDesk. A second agreement allocated Thapaliya 2.5% of the token's total supply, worth more than $50 million at recent prices. Movement Labs told CoinDesk the signed agreements with Thapaliya were not binding, but Thapaliya claimed the agreements \"were never voided.\" While framed as memoranda of understanding — normally considered non-binding — the agreements examined by CoinDesk also include provisions stating \"both parties\" must consent to their termination. \"I plan on pursuing legally to exercise my claim to retrieve 2.5% of tokens,\" Thapaliya said. Employees at Movement referred to Thapaliya as a “shadow co-founder” and said he was often consulted by Scanlon and Manche for major decisions. His name also surfaced in internal communications regarding Movement’s deal with Web3Port. The Chinese market maker was later blamed for dumping $38 million in tokens after MOVE’s debut — an event that triggered a sell-off and Binance account bans. The amount loaned to Web3Port, 5% of MOVE's supply, was identical to the amount loaned to Thapaliya per the agreement. When contacted by CoinDesk in advance of the initial investigation, Thapaliya denied having any financial interest in Movement Labs or the Movement Foundation. He also denied involvement in the Web3Port deal. In later messages on Signal, Thapaliya told CoinDesk that his work with Movement was consistent with their agreement: “As per the contract signed in February 2023, I fulfilled the agreed terms by supporting Cooper [Scanlon] in exchange-related discussions, strategizing token allocation, assisting with market maker selection, and helping hire the team that audited his airdrop model.” The use of informal agreements to quietly allocate tokens to insiders reflects a broader pattern within the crypto industry, where large sums can change hands without appearing in official fundraising disclosures. In 2024, CoinDesk reported that Eclipse — another project linked to Thapaliya — secretly allocated 5% of its token supply to an employee at Polychain, a major crypto venture firm that later invested in the project. Polychain is also an investor in Movement Labs. Eclipse's deal with the Polychain employee was scrapped following the publication of CoinDesk's investigation. What these cases illustrate is not necessarily fraud, but the ease with which crypto startups can make significant financial commitments behind closed doors — commitments that can later shape the trajectory of an entire token ecosystem, often without the community or even some employees ever knowing. One person familiar with the matter said Movement's agreements were tailored to explicitly avoid disclosures to investors or community members. In another 2023 agreement obtained by CoinDesk, Movement Labs agrees to give an entity linked to Vinit Parekh, \"Digital Incubation Group,\" $50,000 annually for every $1 million raised by Movement Labs — a sum that would total approximately $2 million per year, based on Movement’s $38 million in funding. Another agreement granted a separate Parekh entity control of 2.5% of the MOVE token supply. In exchange for his allocation, Parekh’s firm, Digital Incubation Group, was tasked with a broad mandate, including: “development of strategy framework, validated by relevant stakeholders; consultation through the pre-seed raise process (including advice and connection to investors), close seed raise; development of tokenomics and release plan; engage in structuring team pre-product launch.” Like Thapaliya’s agreements, Parekh's were structured as memoranda of understanding with a termination clause requiring consent from both \"parties.\" Parekh and Movement Labs both said the agreements were exploratory and that funds never changed hands between either party. Two people close to Movement Labs said that Parekh, a Microsoft product manager-turned blockchain industry consultant, was nonetheless a frequent presence at Movement's San Francisco office and played a role in the company's hiring, marketing, and strategy decisions. \"I just care about the ecosystem,\" Parekh told CoinDesk in an interview. \"No money was given to me or to anyone I know,\" in connection to the agreements, \"[b]ut I did help them on the marketing strategy and understanding how to do go-to-market.\" The fallout from Movement’s market-making scandal has exposed a widening rift between its co-founders, Manche and Scanlon. After an excerpt from one of the Thapaliya agreements leaked on X, Manche pointed to Scanlon’s signature on the memo, highlighting his former partner’s role in approving the deal. He also reposted a message questioning whether Movement Labs was “throwing [Manche] under the bus” while Scanlon “played innocent.” Manche was ousted from Movement Labs earlier this month, shortly after CoinDesk reported he had helped coordinate the project’s controversial market-making agreement with Web3Port and an intermediary known as Rentech — a third party that Movement later claimed misrepresented itself in the deal. CoinDesk has since learned that Manche also played a role in facilitating a separate arrangement between Web3Port and Kaito, another crypto project that shares the same director and general counsel as Movement Foundation. A contract reviewed by CoinDesk shows that OpenKaito Foundation loaned 2.5% of its KAITO token supply to \"Whisper,\" an entity linked to Web3Port. The agreement — which was also leaked on X by an anonymous account — was terminated shortly after it was signed, according to an X post from Kaito founder Yu Hu. Unlike the Movement deal, it did not include terms that experts said incentivized pump-and-dump behavior. A person familiar with the matter said Manche introduced Kaito to Rentech, which then connected the project to Web3Port. The controversy has already dented Movement’s reputation in an industry that once saw the startup as a rising star. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, announced it would suspend trading of the MOVE token on May 15. The token’s price fell by 50% in the following week. On May 7, Movement Labs said it would spin out a new entity, Move Industries, to serve as the network’s primary developer. Scanlon remains with the organization but has stepped down as CEO.

        "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Imagine two major newspapers both endorsing the same presidential candidate. The joint support indicates that the candidate probably has a broad backing. Similarly, when price charts for both bitcoin BTC$103,393.03 and Strategy (MSTR) — the largest publicly-listed BTC holder — show concurrent bullish signals, it’s likely a strong sign that the market and major institutional players are aligned. Daily price charts for both BTC and MSTR show their 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) crossing above their 100-day SMA to confirm a so-called bullish crossover. It's a sign the short-term trend is now outperforming the longer-term trend, which could be a signal of the beginning of a major bull market. BTC's bull cross is consistent with other indicators like the MACD, suggesting the path of least resistance is on the higher side. That said, an interim drop below $100,000 cannot be ruled out, as on-chain data show influential market participants have turned cautious. The chart shows BTC's price rally has stalled in the $101,000-$107,000 range. A downside break could trigger more profit-taking, potentially deepening the bull market pullback to support at $98,000.  Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.  Omkar previously worked at FXStreet, writing research on currency markets and as fundamental analyst at currency and commodities desk at Mumbai-based brokerage houses. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot. About Contact",

The integration means that users of “every crypto wallet” will be able to access virtual Mastercards that draw directly from their stablecoin balances. The cards can be used at any merchant in Mastercard’s network. The rollout comes amid a broader trend. Mastercard has last month unveiled end-to-end stablecoin capabilities as it moves deeper into the cryptocurrency economy, and partnered with OKX to launch a debit card with the exchange. Similarly, crypto exchange Kraken teamed up with Mastercard to let its users in the UK and Europe spend their cryptocurrency at any merchant in the payments giant’s network. Earlier this year, Mastercard also began supporting tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on its network through a partnership with Ondo Finance, which offers tokenized U.S. Treasury bills.

        "content": "Venture capital firm a16z Crypto has led a $7 million seed round for KYD Labs, a blockchain-based ticketing platform aimed at giving artists and venues control over ticket sales, fan data, and revenue.  The investment comes as KYD looks to expand its presence in the live event space, already showing success at iconic venues like New York’s Le Poisson Rouge (LPR), the firm said in a press release. Founded by Ahmed Nimale, a former product manager at Ticketmaster, and David Barrick, creator of the ad-tech platform Flipmass, KYD Labs is looking to address long-standing issues in ticketing: lost revenues by artists and venues. Typically, artists and venues lose out on revenue as secondary sales and ticket platforms control customer data. KYD aims to change that by offering venues direct access to fan insights and revenue streams. \"We built KYD, which stands for 'Keep Your Distribution,' to make sure no artist or venue ever has to ask again for something that is rightfully theirs,\" said Nimale, who is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 in Toronto.  KYD's platform, built on Solana, offers a streamlined ticket-buying experience. Fans can purchase tickets in under 30 seconds with just a phone number, bypassing crypto wallet complexities.  Venues see increased engagement and revenue—LPR reported a 30% rise in ticket sales and millions in additional income since adopting KYD’s system. \"Since adopting KYD’s tools, we’ve been able to double our return on investment and significantly improve overall efficiency,\" said Shannon Wiles, Marketing Director at LPR. The platform also plans to roll out two new protocol layers: the $KYD token to provide capital for venues and tours, and the $TIX reward token to incentivize fan loyalty, functioning similarly to airline miles. These features are designed to strengthen financial stability for artists and venues while fostering community engagement. KYD has processed $4 million in ticket sales and earned over $1 million in revenue within the past year. It plans to expand to more than 100 U.S. venues by 2026 and eventually aims to power live event commerce at major arenas worldwide. By leveraging blockchain for ticketing, KYD Labs is positioning itself as a modern alternative to traditional ticketing giants, promising greater autonomy for creators and a smoother experience for fans.

        "content": "Bitlayer, a bitcoin Layer 2 based on the BitVM paradigm, and Sui blockchain have teamed up to make bitcoin (BTC) more useful in the Sui ecosystem. The collaboration involves Sui integrating Bitlayer’s BitVM bridge to launch Peg-BTC (YBTC), a Bitcoin-backed token, on its platform, according to an exclusive announcement shared with CoinDesk. It allows bitcoin holders to transfer their BTC into Sui via the BitVM bridge. The bridged version, Peg-BTC, can then be used within Sui’s DeFi ecosystem to earn additional yields. \"Bitcoin’s dominance as a store of value is unmatched, but its utility in DeFi remains untapped. By integrating Bitcoin’s liquidity into Sui’s ecosystem, Peg-BTC (YBTC) empowers users to earn yield while maintaining direct exposure to BTC’s value—a paradigm shift for BTCFi,” Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer, said in a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk. BitcoinFi, or allowing BTC users to earn additional yields through DeFi, was one of the hottest topics at the Token2049 conference in Dubai. Franklin Templeton backed the idea at the event, saying it will boost BTC's appeal beyond the long-prevalent store of value story. Bitlayer is the Bitcoin-security equivalent Layer 2 built on the BitVM paradigm to bring smart contract capabilities to bitcoin without influencing its core consensus. It relies on off-chain computation and on-chain fraud proofs to keep the network secure and decentralized. Bitlayer's BitVM-powered zk bridge is a special tool that facilitates safe and secure movement of BTC onto different blockchain ecosystems without relying on centralized intermediaries or middlemen. It’s trust-minimized, meaning it’s designed to be very secure and decentralized. Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain focusing on offering high-speed and low-cost transactions through parallel processing. As of writing, its DeFi ecosystem comprised 49 projects, boasting over $2 billion in crypto deposits, per data source DeFiLlama. Integrating Peg-BTC (YBTC) into the Sui ecosystem opens up several new opportunities for users, like staking Peg-BTC to earn interest through various Bitcoin staking protocols. Users can also lend or borrow Peg-BTC by lending it out to earn yields or using it as collateral for loans. Additionally, Peg-BTC can be traded on popular decentralized exchanges within Sui, allowing users to swap and provide liquidity to earn trading fees. Hu said they plan to work with Sui's top protocols, with the biggest traction in terms of total value locked, fully diluted value and user base within the Sui ecosystem. Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO at Mysten Labs, the company behind Sui, said they are taking a holistic approach while catering to the growing demand for BitcoinFi. \"Sui is taking a holistic approach by onboarding a full stack of infrastructure and BTCfi asset options into the ecosystem, including staking, restaking, bridge integrations, WBTC, sBTC, and soon Peg-BTC (YBTC). Demand is growing for Bitcoin to serve a greater purpose beyond simply being held,\" Abiodun told CoinDesk. \"Key integrations, such as the BitVM bridge with Bitlayer, are transforming the experience for Bitcoin holders by enabling them to earn, engage with DeFi, and put their assets to work on Sui,\" Abiodun added. As of today, BTC assets comprise over 10% of the total TVL locked in the Sui ecosystem, with over 587 BTC flowing into DeFi since February. \"With support for leading BTCfi integrations, Sui’s advanced programmability activates Bitcoin’s utility, enabling users to move beyond holding and into a secure, high-performance chain,\" Abiodun noted.

        "content": "Tokyo-listed investment firm Metaplanet (3350) generated 592 million yen ($4 million) in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025, largely through bitcoin-based income strategies. The company reported 877 million yen in revenue, with 88% coming from option premium harvesting on bitcoin BTC$103,385.16, according to its first quarter earnings release. Metaplanet’s bitcoin stash grew by more than 5,000 BTC in the quarter to reach 6,796 BTC. The firm has achieved 68% of its 10,000 BTC target just over four months after adopting its bitcoin standard on April 8, 2024, according to the document. This aggressive accumulation has helped it become the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and the top in Asia. The company recently overtook El Salvador in the metric. To finance its BTC accumulation, Metaplanet sold bonds, issued equity, and sold moving-strike stock warrants that only activate when share prices rise. The company raised 86.1 billion yen through this mechanism, becoming the largest public equity issuer in Japan so far this year. Metaplanet’s capital strategy hinges on leveraging operating cash flow and market-raised funds into bitcoin, boosting its BTC Yield, a metric tracking bitcoin per fully diluted share. That figure jumped 170% year-to-date. Metaplanet’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange went down 2.47% in the last trading session to 593 yen each. The firm’s shares are up 65.8% year-to-date, while BTC is up 8.45% over the same period. Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) rally has paused above $100K, slowing the recovery rallies in major altcoins. But one coin stands resilient: monero (XMR), the world's largest privacy-focused digital asset by market value. XMR has risen 4.6% this week to $347, with prices gaining 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency has outshone every other top 100 token by market value in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the market leader, has dropped 1.6% in the past 24 hours, taking the weekly decline to 2%. Monero’s performance is even more impressive, considering its 110% recovery from the low of $165, hit during the early April sell-off when bitcoin dropped to $75,000. XMR's price charts had signaled the meteoric rise with a bullish golden cross a month ago. The rally can be attributed to several factors, including a favorable regulatory outlook, according to HTX. \"In the U.S., the regulatory outlook has shifted as the FIT21 crypto legislation advances and the SEC shows increasing ambiguity in classifying certain tokens, easing market concerns over privacy coin regulation and prompting cautious capital inflows,\" analysts at HTX Research told CoinDesk. The impending Full-Chain Membership Proofs(FCMP++) upgrade, a new and more powerful privacy feature integration, due later this year, may also be galvanizing investor interest. \"FCMP++ enhances Monero’s quantum resistance by providing forward secrecy, ensuring that a quantum adversary cannot break the privacy of past transactions even if they solve the ECDLP. By replacing ring signatures with full chain membership proofs, it eliminates vulnerabilities that quantum computers could exploit to deanonymize transactions,\" Monero society member @DatCryptoPiggie said on X. Here is an analogy to help one understand the above. Imagine having a personal diary with a lock, but there's a risk of someone developing a super-smart device to crack the lock. FCMP++ is likely an added layer of smart lock that will protect currency entries while ensuring that a potential entity managing to bypass the security tricks can't see past entries. HTX also pointed to rumors of major exchanges looking to list XMR as a source of bullish pressure for the cryptocurrency. \"Rumors that major exchanges are considering relisting some privacy coins have further boosted sentiment,\" HTX analysts said. \"Given their lower liquidity and concentrated holdings, privacy coins exhibit higher price elasticity than major cryptocurrencies, often resulting in more extreme price movements when capital enters the market.\" Lastly, some observers have suggested that the recent suspected BTC theft of $330 million may have been laundered through XMR, leading to a bullish price action.

        "content": "Solana (SOL) is starting to see capital flow back in after several weeks of outflows. Glassnode data shows SOL's 30-day realized cap inflows are now firmly back in positive territory, growing at a pace of 4–5%, a level that puts it on par with XRP. While the inflows are relatively modest compared to frenzied periods in December and January, the move marks a trend reversal following a prolonged stretch of realized losses and capital outflows that reflected investor exit and fading conviction. Realized cap inflow is a metric used to gauge actual capital entering or exiting an asset, based on the USD value of coins as they last moved on-chain. It filters out noise from speculative price spikes and instead tracks where holders are actually deploying capital. For Solana, that number turning green again could indicate that buy-side pressure is finally returning, even if price action hasn’t fully reflected it. Inflows into realized cap often serve as a leading indicator, suggesting some traders are positioning ahead of a potential bounce, or at the very least, a sign that capitulation has run its course.
